Student74	Student88	2	"Having never heard of Bloom's taxonomy before, this was a very interesting paper. As a student of the OMSCS, the automation of gra[lastname]g worries me, as there is constantly this idea in the back of my head that the quality of education will suffer from it. As a TA for the OMSCS (in a class where little to no automation of gra[lastname]g tasks is performed) I crave this automation to reduce the amount of resources spent on gra[lastname]g. It may be worth asking around to see if any TAs of this program would be willing to discuss any automation practices they have for their classes (other than the udacity quizzes, of course) and even if some of them would be willing to share class details and possibly help you implement little experiments. Very interesting read. Looking forward to the results!"	8/30/2015 10:44	363		
Student74	Student75	1	"Hi, [firstname]! I would recommend to spend some time on reviewing the paper. While the information is solid, grammar errors and little issues like jumping in between first and third person plural distract and reduce the perception of quality of the publication. Other than that, I am glad to see some inspiration on the CS6310 project! Obviously I am biased, but this sounds like a great idea (and the issues during registration of the last 2 semesters have shown there is a great room for improvement. Hope the best for your project, and I am looking forward to see what comes out of it!"	8/30/2015 10:50	379	6	"Thanks [firstname] very much. Yes, I was little rush this time before submission but will focus on those things that you mentioned on next time. Thanks for your suggestions."
Student74	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	"I completely understand where you are coming from (or at least I think I do). In a public forum about how to spend a huge amount of money the school district had received, I went on a similar rant about how those resources could be utilized to revise the curriculum and focus on new challenges students have (having seen many of those [lastname]slate into issues for college freshmen). The outcome: they just used that money to buy laptops for every student. Having said that (and I know it is still early on the semester) there seems to be a lot of great ideologies behind your paper, but it would be very difficult for me to explain clearly what the idea of your research is. The problems you describe are big and widespread, and without a good and focused plan it may be too big of a research project to tackle."	8/30/2015 10:56	381	7	"You're right, I probably do need to focus in further. Thank you."
Student74	Student93	2	"Well written, really good information, nicely focused. The best paper of the 4 I had to give feedback for! My only feedback would be the scope of the project. It seems like it could get complicated and out of hand really quickly. Beware the scope creeps! I enjoyed rea[lastname]g this a lot. Thank you!"	8/30/2015 11:03	306	7	This is extremely helpful as I have the same concern about this getting very complicated
Student38	Student8	1	"This sounds like a fascinating idea for a learning tool. I don't know much about the subject of autism, but I think it is very broad. I have heard it referred to as a ""spectrum"" which makes me think that this project is probably addressing a particular audience and particular problem within that spectrum. To define the audience for this tool, perhaps there is more information that can be found regar[lastname]g what aspects/problems within autism this tool will try to help with. This looks like a great idea for a design project - its substantive but limited enough to be possible to do in a semester. Good luck!"	8/30/2015 10:36	981		
Student38	Student67	1	"I was captivated by this discussion of creating the right environment to motivate learning and achievement. Advertisement is (sometimes unfortunately) a powerful medium, so this might be a very positive way to use it. As an aside, this topic reminded me that long ago I read ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (NOTHING at all like the 2003 movie). In it, the father (who was an efficiency expert), was always surroun[lastname]g his children with an environment where they almost couldn't help but learn something - to the point that he put morse code alphabets on the bathroom wall and left secret messages around the house in morse code to encourage learning. In a way, he was ""advertising"" knowledge he wanted them to have and using this to encourage their curiousity. Good luck with your project!"	8/30/2015 10:35	3046	6	
Student38	Student26	1	"This sounds like a great project, and gets to the heart of the problem of scaling quality in higher education as classes get bigger or perhaps more diverse as in Dr. Ford's example discussed here. It sounds like your team is already discussing how to solve this and what technical information you need to bring into the discussion. Is there additional scholarly information on the problem from an educational perspective that should be investigated as well in framing the problem generally, to explore what has already been done elsewhere, and to demonstrate where this project fits into that framework? Good luck with your project - it sounds ambitious and immediately useful."	8/30/2015 10:35	3749	7	"Yes this is a good point. I am doing research in terms of ""what all else is out there""; not so much looking into theoretical research. My team member is actually looking more into the theory aspect and then we can share out fin[lastname]gs."
Student38	Student13	2	"Wow this is just great. It almost makes me want to abandon my own direction and follow you in yours. The whole subject is near and dear to my heart (and I'm sure other OMS students). It's also very ambitious and I applaud you for taking it on. It could yield some truly valuable data and since it is KBAI you are studying, I think that a lot of data is there to investigate. Best of luck on the research project and I look forward to hearing more about it!"	8/30/2015 10:35	4185	7	"Thanks so much ! It is really encouraging to get this feedback and I look forward to helping close the loop on many questions about our program and (when I get other content outside of KBAI), what it takes to build a successful graduate MOOC program like ours and support a diverse collection of learners! Thanks!"
Student10	Student58	1	"This sounds like a very useful problem to work on - I know that I inevitably end up abusing hint systems. One thing to consider however - it looks like you are framing this around preventing abuse of a hint system, whereas I think another angle to look at it is to build a hint system that optimally helps facilitate learning. Do we care if students ""cheat"", so long as they learn? Research shows that learning is optimal when students are challenged but not overwhelmed, and I see a hint system as a way to pull people out of the overwhelmed trap. Also consider that hints could be a proxy for measuring student understan[lastname]g - people using a lot of hints could be seriously struggling with the content,. I really like the idea - there's a lot of poten[firstname]l, and I think that it is general enough that it could be useful in a variety of different areas. Have you put any thought into the types of problems that you want to build a hint system for?"	8/30/2015 10:42	942	7	[firstname] had some insight into how to better frame the question.
Student10	Student47	1	"Really interesting idea - especially the last observation about special needs students. I think that involving the parents of students in whatever system you build is going to be very important. Some open questions to think about though: how do you decouple this from grades? And often good behavior in class rooms is the absence of bad behavior - ie. a good student sits quietly and takes notes for the most part. How do you reward these students? And how do you prevent playing to the game - that is, you get what you measure? Also consider that research seems to show that negative [lastname]forcement does not work (not that you focused on negative [lastname]forcement). Anyway though, I really like the idea, I think even just having measurable statistics of classroom behavior will be hugely important."	8/30/2015 10:58	395		
Student10	Student60	2	"On low retention - 9% of a lot of people is still a lot of people. And I was pretty bad for sampling MOOCs - I would sign up for 3-4 and only finish 1 typically. I really like your idea - I think that you've found a very core issue with MOOC and online education. I've found study groups useful even in classes that don't require group work - living in NYC I'm lucky that there are a lot of other people in the program. I really think that this is a key issue that you have found. Especially at a big scale, it can be difficult to find group members - best of luck, I'll be watching what you come up with."	8/30/2015 11:05	1554	7	Thanks. The feedback is helpful and inspiring.
Student10	Student33	1	"They're probably a little bit too young for it, but check out DrRacket as well - it's probably my favorite programming environment. The quick tutorial gives you an idea of the kind of neat stuff you can do with it: http://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/ On actual games teaching logic, here's a real gem: http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/ - you basically program robots to solve problems. It gets very hard very quickly, but it's a lot of fun. I guess another question to consider is why traditional means of education don't work as well with kids, and how your solution will address them. You mentioned lack of focus as one - but the question is, what causes that lack of focus? Interested to see what you come up with - learning how to program is I think a very important area."	8/30/2015 11:31	911		
Student32	Student75	1	"Hi [firstname], What an fantastic idea! A forecasting system for administrators in order to effectively and efficiently plan and prepare for the upcoming semester's course demands! I'd like to offer some modifications/enhancements to your list of assumptions: 1) (bullet #5) In the OMSCS program, once a student completes their foundational requirements they can take up to 3 classes. 2) (bullet #7) Clarification, seniority would be based on total 'Earned Hours' and (maybe their GPA - in case addressing high-demand classes with limited capacity) 3) (bullet #8) Perhaps a set of criteria for class size parameters? For example: Target class size (ideal class size based on available TAs and Graders) and Max. class size. 4) (new) Allow the student to prioritize their choices when they provide a desire to register for more than one course. This option could then be factored into the class allocation formulas. Awesome [firstname], I anxiously await how your project challenge will progress :-)"	8/30/2015 11:29	7	6	Thanks [firstname] very much for your suggestions � I will add/modify those points.
Student32	Student19	1	"Hi [firstname], Great reflection! Everything you said I agree with how CS and math (specifically problem solving) are inexplicably linked. The ability to break down a problem into its discrete components is critical to obtaining a solution. I like the examples you've provided such as Scratch, Xcode's playground, remote virtualize teaching environments, and even a learn-programming-through-story-telling book (that'd be very interesting to see)! I am very curious to learn what your final challenge will be how how you plan to tackle it ;-)"	8/30/2015 11:29	1547	7	
Student32	Student74	1	"Hi [firstname]! Great to see you again ;-) Your reflection of what you researched and learned is very focused, excellent! You've piqued cu[lastname]ity about Apple's ResearchKit, I didn't realize it existed and definitely worthwhile to have in our repertoire of useful development tools; thank you for its introduction! I am really looking forward to how you progress in this project, it looks like a fantastic and very worthwhile effort, I sincerely hope you tremendous success! = [firstname] ="	8/30/2015 11:55	2093		
Student32	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	"Hi [firstname], I couldn't help but laugh (with you) while rea[lastname]g reflective essay. I can definitely related to nearly all of your 7 points and the amazing thing is that you can apply these ""rants"" to nearly everything where technology is applied hastily. As an owner of a technology services company where we provide technology solutions for small and medium size companies I can't tell you how many times I've had clients ""buy"" some technology they had no idea how to use. They just read or heard that this was ""something"" that the needed for their business, spent the money, and then were completely stuck with something they didn't have a clue what to do. I agree with you, there should be an established best practices or standard guide that can qualify and quantify the validity of implementing new technological solutions for EdTech. For example (albeit a rough example): obviously though, the challenge will be to do this without creating yet another red-tape ladened bureaucratic process. Guide to How to Implement New Technology 1) Must define clear scope a) Grade levels impacted b) Subjects/Class impacted c) ... 2) Educational Benefit a) To the Students... b) To the Teachers... c) To the Administrators... 3) Financial Benefit 4) Cost 5) Alternative Solutions 6) Proof of Concept 7) Pilot Group Implementation 8) Deployment Plan 9) Support & Maintenance 10) Lessons Learned - Future Implementation Recommendations In addition to the how-to best practices, it is just as important to establish an EdTech standards, a quick Google search yielded the following interesting links: * http://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards (Note: I saw someone linked to one of these pages in Piazza this, I just couldn't find it) * http://www.k12.wa.us/edtech/standards/ I wish you the best and good luck on your project. = [firstname] = P.S. One suggestion, please put your name into your essays, although your submission is associated with your T-Square ID it'd be nice to know who we're collaborating with."	8/30/2015 13:19	33	7	"Thank you for the links, and I will be sure to put my name in it next time! Mike"
Student72	Student15	1	"I'm not sure I totally understand the goal. Is it to automatically do what web content developers should be already manually doing when new content is submitted? I checked out this page: http://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/1678-Tagging-your-web-content to learn more. Maybe an example would help me understand better. But, does it really matter if I get? You do, of course. :)"	8/30/2015 11:20	766		
Student72	Student22	2	"Wow! Lots of ideas bouncing around in your head, huh? I like idea #3 best myself. I have wondering about that same question before and would love to read your paper on it. Personally, we home schooled my twins you are 20 now and during middle school they used a math series called ""Life of Fred"". It used humor in the lessons. I would be interested to learn if this style worked before, worse or the same as the more traditional textbooks."	8/30/2015 11:33	750		
Student72	Student71	1	Good luck with the app! Sounds promising. I would think an app that provides social skills training to both neurotypical (NT) and non-neurotypical (NNT) children would be interesting to consider and if you could find a way to meld the two audiences so that their experiences incorporated the a more diverse point of view that could help young people learn to appreciate our differences and gain skills in communicating with all their peers.	8/30/2015 12:22	44	1	Thanks for the idea on NT and NNT. I will bring that to the project team table.
Student72	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	2	I really like your idea of a portal that makes it simple for educators to set up lessons that incorporate different media to address the many different ideal learning styles that could be present in the student population that lesson is targeting.	8/30/2015 12:23	556		
Student2	Student65	1	"Interesting read. It sounds like your teaching experience is serving to guide your research very well! I think it will also help focus your eventual efforts into something really valuable. I can see why you'd be interested in an intelligent tutoring system, but I'm somewhat confused as to your goal for its use. Most systems I've seen are standalone applications targeted for use outside the classroom. Is your goal to integrate them into classroom lessons, and lecture on areas students are struggling in after receiving real-time feedback from mini-quizzes? Or, instead, would the application be the focus of the course (perhaps the two weeks before the AP exam, or something to that effect) and you're going around gui[lastname]g students? Another approach I could imagine is using the application as homework, to help you adjust future lesson plans. Learnerator does looks really nice -- I've never heard of that before. I see how it might not be what you're looking for, though. It sounds like there's a great deal of development effort into developing modern intelligent tutoring systems. Maybe the product would be more approachable if you focused on one area of AP CS? Such as designing an intelligent tutoring system for OO Design or Arrays. Plus, I'm sure with your knowledge and work so far that you'll be able to find a group to team up with. I think most people are feeling overwhelmed at this point, so I wouldn't sweat it. You have some awesome experience fueling your work and I can't wait to see what you do!"	8/30/2015 12:25	1151	7	
Student2	Student94	1	"Interesting paper! Particularly for me, since I'll confess I've never heard of the Montessori approach. I really like how you included figures (and a table, which was very valuable). So valuable -- I'll definitely be inclu[lastname]g more in my own work now. As for content, excellent work framing the area of research. Background was sufficient and the [lastname]slation to an EdTech project was well motivated. However, I'm not quite sure why the approach is unobtainable to most. It sounds like the class sizes could be larger than traditional high quality methods. Which should result in a less expensive education, since teacher labor far out[firstname]ghs things like physical tools. Or -- is the problem that public schools haven't adopted the approach en masse, and private schooling is the prohibitive cost? Perhaps I'm not well informed, but this part wasn't clear to me. The method to investigate your problem is interesting. Do you think it's a broad enough approach? Are tools really the crux of the Montessori style, or is the overall technique and ideology the big differen[firstname]tor? That said, it sounds like you're zooming in a bit and I just didn't realize it. I think it's smart to investigate a specific subset of a larger problem since our time is limited. My take away is that you're specifically investigating technological replication of the Montessori approach in teaching shapes."	8/30/2015 12:44	876		
Student2	Student76	2	"Really nicely done -- this is the most methodical and well-composed Assignment 1 I've read (of 3). My feedback is much shorter since I don't have as much of value to add. Beginning is good and motivates the need for more accessible ITS. Excellent point on the ""Assistance Dilemma;"" something that seems really obvious as a weakness, but something that I hadn't even considered despite brief research on ITS. Also good to point out gauging student response, which is what I'd say most people think of as the biggest weakness in intelligent tutoring. I think using Kinect would be a really cool project for ITS. One thing I'm asking myself as I finish your paper, is how does it benefit development time? I'm guessing most of the development hours in ITS are geared at the adaptive engine and handling of scena[lastname]. Even if the dev kit for Kinect is great, it doesn't dent the standard hours requirement, which is something you posed as a big problem. Awesome idea and I hope you pursue it."	8/30/2015 12:59	2558		
Student2	Student44	1	"I like your assignment structure -- super organized. I think that's a big benefit for a formative paper like this. I think your question's really interesting, and certainly very important. Motivation is a huge determinant in students' success. It's definitely applicable to EdTech. My biggest piece of advice would be to narrow your scope. You're posing a huge, important research problem. You could make it more specific and more applicable to EdTech is one swoop. For example, you could study how technology can be used to motivate middle school math students. Personally, I've done tutoring for college students, and one minor piece of technology I used to help pupils was a little scheduling application. Even something as simple as a visual indicator of what to do when helped. There's definitely plenty of room for you to dig in here! It seems like you've done some good research, and that you've got an interesting problem statement. I think if you can focus in a bit you'll have a really cool project."	8/30/2015 13:42	453	6	Spot on. Exactly what I needed to hear this week. Thanks.
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student99	2	"[firstname], i think your idea is very interesting! I think a successful portal like this would help bring much needed innovation to education world. I am looking forward to hearing more on how you plan to harness knowledge and gaps into meaningful information, that can be used to develop new innovative techs. Good luck!"	8/30/2015 12:43	703	6	
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student15	2	"[firstname], I think you idea is very interesting! I must admit, although i have been working as a volunteer teacher for past 8 years, i was not aware of the concept of curating content. Thanks to you i did learn some thing today : ) I like the research you have provided on content tagging. I do have some questions to get a deeper understan[lastname]g of your proposed product: 1. You mentioned that you wish to create content based on the discovery of the content in the learning context. How would such a product work? In other words, how would collect information for personal preferences of a user? For example If i am a learner and let say that i am interested in learning about history of racial discrimination in Am[firstname]a. And if i prefer an to read historical accounts only from african am[firstname]an authors first. 1. How would you first determine what my inherent preferences are, without me having to explicitly state them for you? 2. how would you dynamically tag and look for articles / content which satisfy my preferences. If you like i would love to discuss these ideas with you on Piazza! Good luck with this"	8/30/2015 12:55	3714		
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student80	2	"This is fascinating! I must admit that i have not thought of connection between game theory and group work, but i think you may be on to something here. I have only surface level knowledge of game theory but I wonder if personal sense of ethics and morality play any role in the outcome? I feel incentives [lastname]e in an individual's mind, if he / she believes in doing the right thing, no matter the cost. Perhaps you can explore that as well ? good work btw !"	8/30/2015 13:57	1619	6	"Continued feedback about the lacking connection supports my belief that this topic is underrepresented in the literature. Of course, it is much more difficult to show that something doesn't exist than that it does. Ethics and morality are useful topics to bring up, and the kind of things to consider for the survey."
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student30	1	"Ned, i think survey would be a good start. I think the challenge would be get relevant answers for your research."	8/30/2015 14:24	469	5	"Hi Kamran, Yes I agree on both counts - I see value in a survey and poten[firstname]l assessment and agree that getting good/useful/relevant information represents a clear challenge. I have several ideas along these lines and I'm confident that I can organize the material meaningfully and collect good data/info."
Misc3	Student21	1	"I like your idea, I've personally run into technical issues trying to setup some of the prereq software (openCV for a Mac was especially challenging). And your right, maybe because we are used to classes on a campus, but the forums aren't used by as many people, you always see the same names. I look forward to what you come up with. Did you think of a plan on how to reach out to past students to get that kind of information?"	8/30/2015 13:33	246		
Misc3	Student37	1	"I was a little unclear on how you are going to research or what research you need to do for your idea. Maybe for the next assignment, but how would this idea take shape? How do you teach something abstract via an online environment for example? Or are you using technology to supplement a class environment? That was also something unclear to me."	8/30/2015 13:38	271		
Misc3	Student85	1	"I can see what kind of a substan[firstname]l benefit this idea could bring to schools and students specifically. Have you done some research as to what this software could look like? If the goal is to reduce paperwork, do you need intelligent software or just a digital version of the assignments that can be graded and reported to the teacher automatically? Or is your solution to create an intelligent tutoring system for grade schools? Would it be universal, as I'm sure each school has a slightly different curriculum? Or will it be dynamic where the software has many modules and the teachers can line it up with their curriculum? I look forward to seeing your prototype."	8/30/2015 13:42	352	7	Good questions! I'll answer using the Discussion box.
Misc3	Student20	1	"I really loved your VR idea, I can see kids really enjoying something like that (even adults would enjoy it). There are also some Augmented Reality SDKs out there that are relatively cheap (maybe as a middle step before fully using a VR environment). I like your overall thought process and I think your on the right track, I only liked science because I was amazed with outer space as a child. I remember they had a program called GATE that would pull us out of class to do science experiments. They where flashy and cool and kept me interested. But the novelty wore off with some people because they couldn't do it on their own. Having something to take home and continue to ""play"" with could keep the excitement going."	8/30/2015 13:48	503		
Student82	Student20	1	"[firstname], this is a great problem to solve. I'll admit I was terrible at math in middle and high school, but instead of shying away I kept signing up for more and more. Math is a subject that does not come naturally and I have to work very hard at to get right. You hit the nail on the head when stating that students get bored by traditional learning. It was easier for me to understand a concept if I knew what the practical application of the concept was. One idea would be to customize a child's math and science education based on their interests. So, if they're interested in a specific career or trade, to teach them the concepts that are relevant to their interests. The paper can be made stronger by inclu[lastname]g specific current research, tools or efforts."	8/30/2015 13:52	408		
Student82	Misc3	1	"Mohamed, you have interesting ideas. There are companies that are trying to achieve what you describe. One example is Civitas Learning in Austin. I think your idea is more encompassing than what they are trying to accomplish though. It's a great idea."	8/30/2015 13:59	821		
Student82	Student37	1	"Something I liked about a previous employer was a suggestion box that anyone could drop anything into it. If a suggestion was selected the individual received a small bonus of $50 on their paycheck. It was an effective way to ini[firstname]te conversation in the company. Even if an idea wasn't selected but the CEO wanted to comment on it, he would do so in front of the whole company. The downside, from my perspective, is that they kept liking my suggestions and so they stopped giving me bonuses to be fair to other people. In a way, because I had so many ideas that ended up being picked up, I was doing extra work for no gain other than the satisfaction of improving the company."	8/30/2015 14:32	359		
Student82	Student85	1	"That's a great idea and in line with my goals albeit we're taking different paths to get there. I think education should be individualized and self-paced starting from Kindergarten using pre-recorded lectures as we do in the OMS CS program. Teachers at the local level would help students as they get stuck and help them work through specific problems instead of lecturing. That way they get back to teaching to the one instead of the many. Students that are bright can move quickly, while students that need help might take a little while longer. There would be no more classes based on age. For me it's a scalability issue, how can every school district offer the same breadth and depth of courses when there are insufficient funds for faculty. The first step to the above model is to create auto-graders that can be extended easily for each domain of knowledge. That way AI is responsible for gra[lastname]g and not individual teachers. The teachers simply serve as mentors."	8/30/2015 14:38	390	5	
Student95	Student22	2	"So in thinking about your 4 ideas, I like ideas 1 and 4 the best. I teach kids how to program so that is one of my interests. There is a lot of info on how to teach kids programming on the net. Perhaps research which approaches are most effective or see if there is some other novel angle on teaching kids to program. It seems like you have put a lot of thought into number 4. I think that would be really helpful in internet classes - and those are only going to get more and more popular."	8/30/2015 13:48	665		
Student95	Student72	2	I think this would be a very interesting research topic. I often wonder how much time elementary school kids should be on the computer and whether that is a good thing or not. The tough thing is to be able to use real scientific data and not just anecdotal evidence.	8/30/2015 13:59	246		
Student95	Student66	2	I think your project of game based technology and mentoring would be very useful and engaging. Games are a good way to engage learning if they are done right. Question is: how are they done right? Also I teach middleschool programming (scratch and javascript (khanacademy.org/cs)) so if you have any questions I would be happy to answer those - Student95	8/30/2015 14:03	355		
Student95	Student28	2	"Although I do think that the OMSCS system of multiple websites connected together in a better was is a noble goal, I think your idea of researching constructivism is would be an excellent project. How do constructivism and technology fit together? How does this apply to OMSCS and MOOCs in general? All good questions."	8/30/2015 14:09	734	7	Thank you for these questions! They're exactly the type of things I am hoping such research could help provide some insights to.
Student7	Student95	1	Your idea is creative. I like that you are looking to solve a need that you have in your life. Your list of requirements for your robot was good. I think it will provide you with a good roadmap for your project.	8/30/2015 14:10	520

Student7	Student66	1	"I like that you spoke to someone who runs a class for teaching children to program to find out what the needs and challenges in the field are. Your Minecraft example was apt. With Minecraft's current popularity with children, I think there is probably a lot for educators to learn from it. Do you know what your final product for the project will be? Are you planning on researching game-based mentoring, or are you planning on creating a working product?"	8/30/2015 16:11	1099		
Student11	Student70	1	"I think that attempting to validate the content would be a monumental task. Validating comments could also prove difficult. I think validating the authors of the blog and comments may be easier to implement. One thing I immediately think of is Stack Overflow and Quora, where the [firstname]ght of the comments are backed by the user's reputation. Have you looked to see if there is an API where you could utilize reputation built in those systems to validate the authority of the writers?"	8/30/2015 14:31	370	6

Student11	Student61	1	"I think it's a great idea to look at how some other smart folks in the room are doing language learning. I would focus on some of the basic constructs of software development. If-Else blocks, loops (iterative and recursive), input/output, string manipulation, collections, etc. I had an idea to build an add-on that could analyze code on the fly and detect common patterns and suggest language specific syntactic sugar to replace that specific code block."	8/30/2015 14:50	343	7	I would love to see the add on and have thought of the same thing would help people learn!!!
Student11	Student92	1	"Pretty interesting stuff. I've never used Code Academy or those online tutors (I'm pretty much the smartest person I see in the mirror every day). I've also never thought about it in the context of a class room and that's a really interesting and, I think, powerful way of utilizing it. We often times lose the social aspect of learning. So what if the agent you build can check to see how long a student takes on a particular piece of code and gauges their mastery of it using time or keystrokes to correctness (I have no idea how to measure mastery) and using that, you can determine which students needs help or encouragement. One thing you didn't touch upon that I thought could be neat is leveraging the classroom and having the students who excelled help those who are struggling with that piece of code. The student who excels gets to [lastname]force by teaching and the student lagging gets personalized help. Good luck with this, I look forward to seeing the results!"	8/30/2015 14:56	690		
Student45	Student61	2	"I love the project idea, I know Java and started learning Python last semester for my computational Photography class. I found online resources very basic and they all start from scratch. Your project will minimize the wastage of time and hopefully make learning new language much more easier. Wish you best in the project. Overall, your submission is succinct and very interesting to read, the best that I had to review."	8/30/2015 15:25	321	7	I tried hard to make my assignment succinct and it is nice that it was noticed!!
Student45	Student92	2	"Teaching programming to high school students is not an easy task. I remember when I took my first programming class in C, I was completely lost. My teacher used chalk and black-board approach and use to write a question and ask us to solve it. I failed in my first class quiz. That evening I started doubting myself that if I had a programming brain or not. My parents suggested me to talk to a private tutor, before giving up. His way of teaching was similar to my class teacher but he would ask us to run the program on our computers and see the outputs by varying inputs. That helped me tremendously and I fell in love with programming. There is a lot that can be done to improve the method of teaching programming to novices. Overall, I loved your write up and its succinctness."	8/30/2015 15:31	640		
Student45	Student41	1	"My reasons for not adopting m-learning is because I find the the screen size too small and it puts a lot of strain on my eyes. Small text size and scrolling again and again makes the whole experience very uncomfortable. I always prefer big screens, even my laptop screen is 17 inches. But I see a lot of kids (the next generation) these days use ipads for learning and they seem much more comfortable using them."	8/30/2015 15:41	474		
Student45	Student51	1	I am so glad to read that you will be able to help your son using this opportunity. You seem to have done quite a bot of research in the field of Video Modeling. I like the ideas which you will be working on and they way you have listed them. Good job.	8/30/2015 15:49	297		
Student28	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"You brought up a great point on cost for implementation. Often, effective classroom technologies has a cost over benefit. Besides the software, hardware is another big cost that needs to be accounted for. In our district, they started equipping middle schoolers with a loaner laptop in order for everyone to take advantage of the ""smart"" classroom technology. Good luck with your topic!"	8/30/2015 15:36	596		
Student28	Student72	1	"Interesting! The big question - is technology good or bad? My answer is depends on how human uses it or lets it lead us.

Student76	Student78	1	"[firstname], like you, I am focusing on working with the ITS domain. There are a host of challenges; some of which you touch on here, and some that you will find in your further research.

Student76	Student53	1	"[firstname], I am confused how this specifically applies to EdTech (in fact, I did not see the word ""education"" even mentioned in the paper). However, I think this project could be quite valuable to research, if you are able to sufficiently focus on determining metrics on EdTech utilization. Many high quality applications do not see heavy use, maybe you could determine why and how to leverage/fix the issue so that domain development efforts are not wasted.

Student76	Student65	1	"[firstname], I appreciate your candid feedback. Like you, I am focusing on the ITS domain. This class does have the poten[firstname]l to be overwhelming, and to such an extent that you have to focus on a specific niche or realize that your research/project will take quite some time to implement. The main point you make in your paper is effectively one of the greatest challenges facing ITS: developing intelligent tutoring systems is expensive in development, time and system resources. For example, the Cognitive Tutor carried a 200-1 development hour/instruction hour cost. Also, there is a significant ""Assistance Dilemma"" that ITS do not typically answer well, particularly from students who may lack self-motivation. I would have liked to see a few more points on outstan[lastname]g issues facing ITS, especially focusing on where human tutelage is significantly better (i.e. gauging responses and understan[lastname]g knowledge capture).

Student76	Student94	1	"Student94, very interesting topic! As a father of a two year old, I am very interested in the Montessori methodology. As you state, so much of its philosophy is firmly rooted in the concrete... I think a button/tile program could work quite well. http://www.mobilemontessori.org/ contains many Montessori inspired applications. I would be interested to see how you could extend past these apps to create something that could take it up a level. There is a great poten[firstname]l for cross-deploying these apps as both Montessori training and autism/special needs training. Easter Seals use hardware that is functionally very similar to what the Montessori school teaches, for example."	8/31/2015 1:21	328		
Student93	Student82	1	"This is a great reflection and quite ambitious goal (at least in my opinion). I like the idea of the ""thought vectors"" by Google and I recently came across that article as well. I really think you should explore it further and you are on the right track - start with tracing the original blogs. Additionally, this reflections shows a good use of existing publications so you have done your research pretty well. I would like to be able to follow up on your progress if possible."	8/30/2015 15:51	779	6	I'm still thinking about the best way to share my progress.

""If it is not obvious my personal interest is in contributing to the lower levels of Bloom�s Taxonomy"" -- no, it wasn't obvious and I actually have got confused few times which area are you trying to pursue :) You raise many important questions in this reflection and I hope for the sake for educational technology you get your answers!"	8/30/2015 16:06	701		
Student93	Student86	1	"I agree that area you are describing is very vast and should be approached by solving a lot smaller chunks. It looks like you have done a great deal of research on the topic so far, so it would be nice to see some references, but it is not a big deal. I like the decision you are making - to answer one small question at first: ""What is the best possible way to introduce programming to students in middle school?

Student85	mdarden6@gatech.edu	2	"Excellent write-up, [firstname]! I'm happy to see that at least one person shares some of my thoughts for public school education. In my own research, support for/adoption of such software by teachers has emerged as a more substan[firstname]l problem than I would have guessed ini[firstname]lly. I'm curious for your thoughts on that as well as recommen[lastname]g it as a bullet item for your list. Another point of recommendation particularly relevant for you since you're working with more complex material than I will be is what I'll call ""subject matter difficulty analysis""; i.e., the software's ability to identify problem areas for a student and report them to instructors for intervention. In an advanced system like yours I would imagine this to be more than just grade reporting. Good luck with your project - I hope it hits the [firstname]et as a viable product! (BTW, there were a few typos in the document.)"	8/30/2015 15:59	728		
Student85	Student20	1	"Interesting discussion, [firstname]. I agree completely with your decision not to pursue ""gimmicks"" as a means to engage students. Such tricks may succeed at first but are doomed in the long run because the ini[firstname]l interest is in the game, not in the subject matter. Math and science are fascinating subjects that have been reduced to near tedium in schools. Livening the subjects up would be a great service to today's youth! A problem I've not been able to untangle in my own head is that while math and science take significant amounts of study to ""get to the good stuff"", the time available to teach the subjects - and students' attention spans - is short. What ideas do you have to ""cut to the chase"" more quickly in terms of material? It sounds like you have some intense software development ahead - good luck!"	8/30/2015 16:11	549		
Student85	Student21	1	"Hi [firstname]. I've taken Computer Networks and Health Informatics as well and am familiar with the issues you describe. I've found my fellow students to be very helpful via Piazza - much more so than I could ever have imagined before beginning the program. Moreover, my peers have provided much more assistance than the actual TAs in the courses I've taken. Given that, I see the value in what you're proposing. One suggestion I have is to engage with the classes as they are happening and not wait until the end of the semester to gather input. For instance, my team solved numerous problems with our Eclipse/Java/Groovy/Grails/RDBMS environment over the course of the project as well as dealing with many FHIR-related issues as well; however, by mid-April, all thoughts of past difficulties were forgotten as we pushed to the end of the project. So, my advise is to provide a means to collect feedback ""in the moment"" when it is fresh on the student's mind."	8/30/2015 16:20	624		
Student85	Student7	2	"Hi Ben - excellent essay! As a developer myself, I'm interested in the process of learning new tools as well as teaching junior staff to be more productive. I like your idea of using Swift Playgrounds very much. To me, this is the one part of Xcode that stands out above other tools as a frictionless way to get started with basic programming. I also commend your decision to use unit tests as a proving ground for students' work. In the end, writing code to a spec is a critical function; there's no reason not to start that thought process from the beginning! Also, it seems to me that having goals is essen[firstname]l in learning to program. Satisfying unit tests can stand in for real goals during the formative stages of learning when the student has not yet amassed enough knowledge to do anything useful in terms of ""whole application"" development. I'm interested to hear more about how you would [lastname]sition from constructivist learning to practical application development - that is a gulf that has to be crossed before the student can truly be said to be a programmer."	8/30/2015 16:31	622		
Student80	Student100	1	"HTML/CSS seems like a good next target after programming. One can imagine students eventually tagging their free-form papers to facilitate automated gra[lastname]g. I often do this myself, breaking the rubric down into sections and inclu[lastname]g them in the paper to ease the grader's work. You list ""among others"" for you tools and frameworks to look into. I'm going to list some here since I don't know what you already know. I think syntax checking tools might be a fruitful avenue of investigation. chktex http://baruch.ev-en.org/proj/chktex/ I addition to raising warnings against, it makes stylistic suggestions, inclu[lastname]g stuff in the main text such as parenthesis balancing. eslint http://eslint.org/ It's a javascript checker, but again its plugability and rule system might be informative. I imagine you could build rulesets for individual assignments. syntastic https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic A massive syntax checker for vim. It might lead to other stuff because people can build checkers for non-programming languages. For example, cucumber. Cucumber https://cucumber.io/ It strikes a ba[firstname] between human and parsable. Lastly, all this looking at plugins makes me think of adjustable autonomy in robotics.

Student80	Student99	1	"In evolutionary terms, the ""fittest"" are not those with a high level of absolute fitness. All that is required for selection is to have a high level of fitness. Given this, it should be possible for education to improve, as long as the improvements made have higher levels of relevant fitness. Of course, evolution is blind, so this might not be a fast process. How would this bridge-gaping tool help innovators? Would it be aimed at increasing absolute fitness? Would it facilitate an environment of competition so that better solutions would be selected? A last note, who is the ""user"" that the tool would be centered upon? At first blush, the users ""education"" would seem to be students, but many tools are aimed at teachers. Frequently, neither teachers nor students make buying decisions, so a innovations targeted at them do not get selected. Could an edtech tool address selection criteria?"	8/30/2015 16:26	688	5	
Student80	Student30	1	"I don't recall anything from your personal statement, since I didn't read it! Assignments rotate through different readers in peerfeedback. What form do you imagine your project taking? Will it be a research paper discussing a survey? Will it be a tool for surveying a population? As discussed in the assignment description, you can make a proposal here and [lastname]e it later. I think the advantage to this approach is that it allows you to get your mind into the environment of the proposal. Thus, you will see some things that might or might not work. As it is, since you haven't proposed something more concrete, it is difficult to make headway without getting feedback. But, it's hard to give feedback, since there isn't a concrete thing to discuss, so it's a vicious cycle. Based on my rea[lastname]g of your assessment, I would pretend I was committed to the ""survey the population and publish an article on the current state of affairs."" If, in doing this research, you find something that needs to be addressed, you could just switch to that. If you find the situation too murky to make a decision, others probably do, too, and your survey results will help future decision makers (yourself included.)"	8/30/2015 16:38	1080	5	"Hi Student80, I understand your comment - my 'proposal' was meant to be high level - simply to survey the current state of ed tech along the specific lines discussed, poten[firstname]lly answering questions as I outliined: So, my thought is that I cannot possibly jump into a specific project without having an objective survey and framework for the state of Ed Tech today � (1) what are the major area/domains, (2) who are the major players and providers, (3) what products/services/business models are in use, (4) what are the quality/use/acceptance/utility of these, (5) and what are the trends and KPIs for these, (6) what is the state of research, and what education theories and practices are incorporated into these, and how, (7) and beyond trends, are there any patterns of adoption and efficacy that we can see, and (8) is there an emergent vision? I see such a survey as foundational � at least for myself � in understan[lastname]g in detail the Ed Tech landscape as it is today � in both the widest sense of the word and in poten[firstname]lly several deep and meaningful ways.

Student80	Student43	1	"Group work is an interesting topic. I'm curious how effective it is vs solo work for learning. I have known teachers to cite it as less work for them, but students often complain about their teammates. I would add to your list cooperation as a question. Communication, coor[lastname]ation, and evaluation rely on cooperation as a basis. The work I am doing this semester is on examining cooperation in group work from the perspective of game theory. I'm curious if you could build mechanisms to aid teachers in evaluating the cooperation of group members? What do you imagine the end result of your research will be? A summary of current publications? A survey on what students and teachers like and use? Or will these be purely facilitative toward creating an app, whose structure is unclear at this time because you still need to have research results? How feature rich to you imagine this app would be this semester? You might not know which features to select, but do you have an idea of how many features you can support?

Like you, I would like basically throw ""burst"" of knowledge via a mobile app. I am also researching about the motivation for the use of these apps/tools/etc and found the self determination theory. It basically explains that in order for people to be self motivated to do anything (like wanting to learn and/or opening the app) it requires 3 components - 1) Competence 2) Relatedness 3) Autonomy so my approach was to somehow incorporate these 3 components into my mobile app. Anyway, I think some of our stuff overlaps.

After mentioning that many school's implementation's of E-Rate funded programs fall short of standards, you mention the amended program that allows for MSPs while proposing extended fiscal assistance for other technologies and staff? Is the problem here the lack of on-site technology managers to manage these programs? Or is it the lack of integration of mobile technologies? What aspects of a 21st century classroom depend on this problem being solved?

You described your approach to exploring topics clearly and vividly, I tend to use a similar approach whenever I'm researching a topic. I believe your approach to using smartphones is good because they have certainly become highly integrated into our daily lives and, based on my own experiences, provide great assistance especially in online learning. It is obvious education is shifting toward higher utilization of technology and online environments, and mobile devices will be an integral part of this future. A [lastname]forcement application would be a great addition to the spectrum. Personally I do not usually do short-burst type of learning; I need to relax and [lastname]sition into the student mindset and then have at least 30 good minutes to focus on what I am trying to learn or revise. If I know I only have 10 minutes I don't usually even try. I believe this has something to do with getting into the state of deep thought. I have noticed the same phenomenon at work (I build software) where I need to be focused on what I'm doing; if I know I have a meeting in 10-20 minutes I don't start anything at that point because I might just get into that deep thought state and then get interrupted. I am mentioning this because I would like for you to consider that angle as well, and have the application meet the needs of students who do studying in short bursts but also those who may need study sessions to last be a bit longer.

Student26	Student67	2	"Hello [firstname] and thank you for sharing your thoughts with your classmates. I thought you got into something very interesting here. Motivation is something we all have to search for at times. And I think that's interesting because we are people pursuing master's degrees, so in the overall landscape of the world we should rank as pretty highly motivated individuals on average. I noticed you were describing a way to motivate people to learn. If you are able to realize that, let me tell you, you could apply that strategy to so many more things in life: professional development, personal health, relationships, this list is endless. Therefore I highly encourage you to continue to explore that path. My personal takes on motivation are there needs to be some incentive. I need a connection with what I am doing and how that leads to some outcome at some later time. That connection has to be evident and clear. I also need to make a commitment toward achieving my short term goals. Financial incentives tend to work well because completion means I get paid and for the same reason I don't want to quit. Another factor that affects my motivation, and this is a bit s[lastname]ge, is how much I have to do. If I feel I don't need to try very hard I start slacking. I need a good full schedule and a little stress to really keep me going on effectively. I'm mentioning this because you might want to do some survey or research more into what are different motivating factors for people to pursue and stick with education or courses they are taking and design the application is such a way that it caters to those motivating aspects specifically."	8/30/2015 18:03	1111	7	
Student26	Student8	2	"Hello Chris, I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your assignment. I believe you have identified an important topic and it is obvious from your own family that the game you are describing could be really beneficial to help teach children with autism. Also it was nice to see your list of questions to explore which was well-formulated an thorough. I should have done better on that myself. I am not sure if you are looking to build some type of action game with a lot of sounds, colors, animations etc. so this might not be useful for you topic but I will give it a shot anyway. I once worked on buil[lastname]g an educational game with stories. They were stories presented as images along text, and a narrator rea[lastname]g the stories out loud. The text would highlight like in karaoke as the story was being read. Over-arching these stories was a game where kids would collect rewards, which was tied into rea[lastname]g the stories. More rea[lastname]g, and better understan[lastname]g or what was read, lead to more rewards. I'm mentioning this because it might give you some ideas about execution. I would recommend going for simple or reusable graphics because games tend to require a lot of effort in that area. I'll be looking forward to seeing what you come up with this semester."	8/30/2015 18:22	1209		
Student26	epennington3@gatech.edu	1	"Hello [firstname]. I think your assignment was an interesting read. I can tell you have already found a quite a defined focus on what you will be working on and what topics to research to get you where you need to go. It seems you are making good progress. I noticed you were making a few references to things outside the scope of this assignment. For us fellow students reviewing your work it is a bit difficult to know what you are referring to because we are missing that background and only have the current assignment to go by. I am mentioning this because I am planning to work on something that might also utilize an intelligent agent, so I would have wanted to know what your idea was more specifically. I will be looking forward to seeing what you come up with though, it sounds really fascinating."	8/30/2015 18:42	732		
Student75	Student86	1	"Thanks [firstname]! In fact, my elder son is going to middle school on this year and I am touch base with him what are the online tools available for the basic programing to middle school students. I know that you have mentioned one of them (ko[lastname]g.com). He also found couple of them like khanacademy.com (a nice start up for JavaScript), learncode.com (emphasis on animation through JavaScript). I will be eagerly waiting for your research and final paper to �introduce basic programming skills to middle school students�."	8/30/2015 18:01	255		
Student75	Student88	1	I went through the link and tried to understand about topics which is very interesting. I hope this will go for the other higher grade too. I will try to go through again sometime later and will add more points if I can. Thank you	9/5/2015 22:24	245

Student75	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	"From the 1st line, I thought the target users are K 1-12. As a dad of 2 younger kids - I understand your concern. But I disagree few things here about the iPad and some other things. I think it's very school district to school district. It's very difficult to generalize it as a whole system. It would be nice if u can provide some some specific areas that you are going to focus. Anyway, good luck. Thank you."	9/5/2015 22:39	381		
Student16	Student87	1	"Interesting topic. While the Occulus devices are fantastic, they are also incredibly expensive. Suggest looking into Google Cardboard and related technologies as well. Would like to see some info on why you think this will be effective. Same material but in 3D, has someone researched interest/retention?"	8/30/2015 18:35	127		
Student16	Student12	0	"This is an interesting problem, but there's no information on how you plan to apply technology to solve your concerns. While Siri/Cortana/Google/whatever is pretty awesome, it's hardly deep conversation and doesn't do well at correcting mistakes. Beyond watching a movie, how can you influence language education? There are some awesome online tools now for language presentation, assessment, and even pronunciation correction."	8/30/2015 18:37	155	3	
Student16	Student32	0	"What common education areas do you see applying games/simulation technologies? Many uncommon hand-on items (pilots, surgeons, mechanics, etc) have electronic tools. Do you see exten[lastname]g these into new areas? Focusing on other disciplines? I wish there was more background on the ITS topic - no idea what this is or how it works."	8/30/2015 18:40	147		
Student16	Student88	1	This is a very broad introduction but full of poten[firstname]l project ideas. Very interesting!	8/30/2015 18:42	63		
Student97	Student47	1	Good writing Jeffry. Researching technology to help manage disruptive behavior will be very interesting. I don't know if recor[lastname]g a class session will be helpful in controlling behavior. I believe people will behave differently on camera and it might help in some way. In some universities it is common to have recorded class so that anyone who miss the class could play the recorded session.	8/30/2015 18:33	598		
Student97	Student54	1	"Academic integrity especially in the source code, sometimes could be very fuzzy, and i agree to some extent diverse student background might also be a barrier factor. But in general I still don't really get what your project exactly is. I suggest you elaborate more about what you wrote as ""better feel"" and restate your problem more explicitly. All the best!"	9/3/2015 9:38	604		
Student97	Student1	1	"Great writing, i enjoyed rea[lastname]g it. Yes it is well known problem that online course and especially MOOC have low completion rate. I hope your research will shed some light on this issue. All the best Sam."	9/3/2015 9:48	983	6	
Student97	Student10	1	"Great writing, you stated your research project goal clearly. Learning mandarin has been very challenging for the rest of us, it is always great to have better way to learn language. All the best!"	9/3/2015 10:05	149		
Student24	Student26	1	"Hello [firstname], The premise of your teams proposal is very interesting, but I can imagine the daunting task of evaluating a web page if there are no predefined set of guidelines or page formatting style sheets to follow. As you mentioned W3C validation services only checks [firstname]up for browser compatibility and rendering. Almost every web developer I know has their own unique style of co[lastname]g and documenting the steps of web page creation. What might help Dr. Ford is to create predefined templates for each co[lastname]g assignment or project which can be used for guideline of html DOM verification. Students might be more creative since the nature of projects is usually open-ended but as long as they confirm to the correspon[lastname]g template it might help Dr. Ford for gra[lastname]g them. Depen[lastname]g on how far your team wants to go with actual steps of evaluating the web page, a quick search comes up with these guidelines. Evaluating Web Pages: http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/Evaluate.html http://lib.colostate.edu/howto/evalweb2.html"	8/30/2015 18:48	190	7	"This was extremely helpful feedback. In fact it highlighted many of the things we have discussed and are still thinking about solving, such as the ""template"" comparison aspect. Those links are very useful too."
Student24	Student13	1	"Hi [firstname] , I see wide range of research topics in your narration and each in its own can be an excellent premise for research study project at least for the scope of this class. You will probably have to narrow down to the specific subject which you would like to focus on. The other poten[firstname]l concern I can see in the context of your statement: �I am interested in using data that has been gathered on student performance and activity to analyze and understand the specific features that drive student�s success within the Georgia Tech OMSCS program.� Does Georgia Tech have privileges to share student Information for school projects? Does it cross the line of student confiden[firstname]lity as described in detail here? https://tech.ed.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Student-Privacy-and-Online-Educational-Services-February-2014.pdf The reason I am asking because from my experience in using student Information in SAAD class, we were only provided de-identified student data-set for our project. We had to fake most of the information (Like Names, Address, Specialization etc) for the sake of using it in a meaningful way."	8/30/2015 19:41	211	7	This is more great feedback and I look forward to using data that is available to better understand what works and what doesn't for programs like ours.
Student24	Student38	1	"I agree with you [firstname], Software plagiarism is very much prevalent at university level and mostly goes unnoticed due to lack of tools to corroborate it or limited resources to purse the matter unless reviewed closely by concerned Staff. Even while working on group projects, you come across some students who are not familiar with most modern day development languages or they lack in experience on actual software development. These students usually tend to participate on other project related activities like documentation. But given that some of the projects are graded individually then these students might be tempted to plagiarize other students work. I believe its really hurting the integrity of higher education as you rightly pointed out. I would be very much interested to follow your work and see the outcome. In today's world of open source resources its becoming very difficult to identify if the real credit belongs to the work submitted by the student themselves or they were just faking someone else work with some minor [lastname]es to original software and forgot to cite the resources. In my work as application developer, I have came across software which was basically picked up online without giving proper credit to original developer. Kudos for showing the courage to tackle the problem."	8/30/2015 22:16	2500	7	I appreciate the time and thought given to my paper. Good point on some of the motivations that may be behind plagiarism.
Student24	Student36	1	"Hi [firstname], You have pointed out the interest in researching three types of common targets for education tools: individual learning, group learning, and community driven learning. It sounds very interesting and given your background I am sure you will do a great job. You will probably need to identify the user base for each group and create some sort of survey questionnaire for analysis. Also if you can narrow down the scope of your study you might be able to do a better analysis. Just a suggestion, as I only have limited understan[lastname]g of myOLE application. Good luck with your project."	8/31/2015 19:29	107		
Student44	Student53	1	"This is a very interesting problem statement that I found well grounded in existing theory. Believe it is a good area for investigation in this class. In fact this would be a cool PHD dissertation. Couple of thoughts came to mind as I read your submission. I wondered if you'll have the time in a single term to study all three types. I believe a lot will be determined by the metrics you need to support a meaningful analysis and that availability of data. In other words, once you define your metrics, will you have to collect your own data, or is it available from an existing source? If you have to collect your own data, how are you going to do that? ...lots of more questions fall off these branches of the tree. In my mind, defining your metrics is the next step. I'll be interested to see what you choose. Good luck and have fun w/ it!"	8/30/2015 19:31	657		
Student44	Student76	1	"Good start to researching your topic. I also find this to be an interesting topic and certainly relevant to our class. Couple of thoughts to guide you over the next week: 1. Define/explain ""Intelligent tutoring systems"" up front. That will define the scope of your area of study. 2. Need to add a problem statement. Ideally an ini[firstname]l problem statement by next week. These guides will help focus you. Good luck and have fun!"	8/30/2015 19:42	279	2	"The point of last week was to define my areas of interest - this week was intended to define the problems in the domain of interest. I would have to go WAAAAY over the 500 word if I have to spend overhead wasted on catching up people each time. These points are very unhelpful and incredibly gen[firstname] to me, most likely because the reviewer did not understand the subject or have time to catch up with what I covered last week. For these reviews to be valuable, the reviewers should either be consistent or actually take time to catch up with the subjects being covered. If we are to cover the background history and introduction to the subject - the 500 word heuristic is completely worthless."
Student44	Student94	2	"Good structure, well organized, clear problem statement. Super good start so far. Recommendations: 1. Move problem statement up to the very front of the document. In fact start out w/ the problem statement. 2. Supporting material can follow in whatever logical order you deem appropriate. I don't have any more feedback right now b/c you covered everything you needed to get started. It appears to me that your next step is to add content describing the tools, their purpose, etc., and then organize the information in your paper. Looking forward to see where you go w/ this. Good luck and have fun!"	8/30/2015 19:47	410		
Student44	Student65	1	"Good honest write up. Well done. Hang in there...there a lot of others feeling overwhelmed this week as well. So your not alone. I am not sure what a ""intelligent tutoring system"" is to be honest w/ you. It sounds interesting though. I have two recommendations to help you focus more this week. 1. Define/describe what an intelligent tutoring system is in the context of your paper. Write this up and include in your next submission. This will help you scope and focus your research. 2. Try to identify at least three known problems associated w/ intelligent tutoring systems and describe them in writing. It is important to write your ideas down. There is magic that happens when you process the idea enough to get it out of your head and commit it to something you can read. Trust me...there is science behind it...but that is another class. 3. Select one of those problems and research how technology might be used to solve that problem. If you run into a brick wall...move on to the second and finally the third if necessary. In closing, remember you need to identify a research area (and you already have) and identify a problem in that area that technology can help solve. And of course get an ""A"" in this class. This sounds like an interesting area to research. I look forward to your final presentation. Good luck and have fun learning!"	8/30/2015 22:30	648	7	
Student43	Student84	1	"I laughed out loud when I read ninja skills and envisioned an army of baby ninjas. I don't have any children of my own, nor nieces/nephews, so I don't get exposed to the all-consumed parent that much. However, I have seen what you're describing in some of my friends and can definitely see a [firstname]et for this. I think you have an interesting idea that could both benefit the parents and if you anonymize and aggregate the data, provide interesting [firstname]eting and/or research data as well. Hope all goes well!"	8/30/2015 19:24	2735	6	
Student43	Student100	1	"[firstname], looks like you have a definite need to fill and a clear idea on how to do it. I wish I was as far along as you! This should certainly be feasible, but make sure to scope an ini[firstname]l version you can complete this semester. Also, not sure if you've come across these yet, but I believe both have HTML courses with ""auto-gra[lastname]g"": https://www.codecademy.com/ https://www.codeschool.com/"	8/30/2015 20:10	1031	6	
Student43	Student90	1	"I think you have a good idea here. I hadn't heard of DD before so looked up further details. Not sure if I would qualify but I had some of the similar issues with math and numbers while in elementary and middle school. I'm still not that great at math itself (definitely not in my head) but one of my teachers in high school stressed writing out every step of an equation to work out a problem and don't try to take shortcuts. ""Do the work on the paper, not in your head"". Since then, I do better, but I always wondered why it took so long for a teacher to tell me that. Anyway, I digressed. Take a look at IXL.com, it might be along the lines you're thinking."	8/30/2015 20:27	2501	7	
Student43	Student50	2	"I take it that you're pretty settled on what you want to pursue and you're well on your way! From my perspective, I think the first question on retention is for those who leave a class, did they originally join the class with the intention of finishing the class. If no, then I'd think you could remove them from your number. As you mentioned, someone may start a class just to get a portion of the available information (especially if there is no financial cost to do so). I'm not aware if this is done, but when someone signs up for a class (in Coursera for example), are they asked their intention to complete the entire course? Also, do these sites send follow-ups to these students along the lines of ""We see you haven't accessed your material recently? Did you get what you needed or can we do more?"" Those were just a couple thoughts I had while rea[lastname]g your paper. I'll be curious to see how it progresses. All the best!"	8/30/2015 21:09	961		
Student83	Student39	1	"It sounds like you are well on your way toward fin[lastname]g a solution to pursue. However, the goal of this assignment was more about the problem. I had a hard time with that in my paper as well - it is more fun to be solution focused. I was able to glean enough information from the assignment to have a vague idea of the problem you want to solve, but a more thorough discussion of it, and what more you need to learn to provide a good solution would have been improvements. As it stands, it seems that you might be getting a little ahead of the game."	8/30/2015 20:17	478		
Student83	Student56	1	"Wow, this represents a lot of work already, and looks like an ambitious project. I feel that this paper went beyond the stated scope a little - rather than focusing on the problem to be solved, it moved closer to mini-proposal territory. However, the problem was well described, so I don't see an issue with getting a little ahead of the game as you have. What more (if anything) do you feel you need to learn about the problem before you begin the research proposed?"	8/30/2015 20:25	540		
Student83	Student34	2	"Excellent problem statement. The issue is very clearly defined, and some awesome insights are provided throughout. I think that solving this problem would be a big deal not just for CCA, but for other theory intensive courses in other programs. Good luck!"	8/30/2015 20:34	311		
Student83	Student24	2	"Given the current level of stress expressed on social media during registration time, it is evident that this problem is a good one to pursue. The paper describes the problem well and even moves toward a poten[firstname]l solution. The stated unknowns are well thought out. Nice work."	8/30/2015 20:40	526	7	Thanks a lot [firstname]. Makes me feel better that I am on the right track.
Student42	Student17	1	"I would definitely agree with the idea that education provides unique opportunities for innovation in education, but what aspect of it would you seek to address? An excellent predictor of academic performance is the income level of the student's family, so how does this affect your hypothesis about performance being tied to methodology? Have you considered the increase in the number of students from low socio-economic groups being serviced or students with developmental disabilities or students that do not speak English as a first language? All of these groups have trended upwards over the last few decades in public schools, and with most districts cutting back on support staff due to a weak economy, these students receive less support services than they used to, so that might provide specific opportunity for you to target your technology ini[firstname]tive."	8/30/2015 21:02	699	7	That is a very valid point that I would have to take into consideration. I am sure that there is very strong correlation between household income and student success. Being able to level the playing field despite variances in home factors will be challenging.
Student42	Student52	1	"Your ""journey"" on the topic of research definitely resonated with me. I approached from a completely different angle but ended up with a very similar idea, using a chat bot/intelligent agent to engage in quality conversation with kids in the Pre-K age group to help close the achievement gap. Google the ""30 million word gap"" if you're interested. Needless to say, I think this is a great research area, and I'll be checking out some of the resources you mentioned here."	8/30/2015 21:14	366	6	
Student42	Student79	1	"[firstname], it sounds like you have a viable project focus already. As an interesting coincidence, my daughter also enjoys rea[lastname]g German children's books (my mother-in-law was born in Germany and my wife is semi-fluent), so I'd certainly be interested in seeing your end product. The idea reminds me somewhat of rea[lastname]g annotated Shakespeare in middle school where some of the more obscure prose was defined in the margins to help the reader get more meaning from the text. I think it's an excellent idea though, particularly for those with at least a basic grasp of a language already, because it could be applied to almost any difficulty of text."	8/30/2015 21:20	554	6	
Student42	Student25	1	"[firstname], correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're describing using service oriented architectures (software in the cloud) to service remote students so they don't have to worry about the hardware/software constraints of using commercial software? This certainly sounds like a good idea, and it would be interesting to see if software vendors are offering licensing for these kinds of setups. I remember using these kind of client server architectures in the office on a local area network in the past, where we shared tools on a central server and had floating seat licenses to access the software, all of which worked great until all the licenses were in use and you couldn't access the software (not that this would be an issue in what you're describing necessarily, but maybe a consideration)."	8/30/2015 21:30	585	7	"Hey Nick, Thanks for the feedback! you are spot on about using commercial software. Licensing has [lastname]ed over the years for a lot commercial software to allow cloud based remote access. Typically you would want to have a 'Site License"" that covers all campus computers (expensive) but there are some software packages that only have floating based licensing with a finite number of seats available at one time. I plan on covering a section on licensing since it always seems to be a gotcha when deploying these types of solutions. Thanks again for the feedback! [firstname]"
Student51	Student83	1	"Mike, both your problems seem worthy of this class. Have you considered combining them? For all of your questions on the skill of diagnosis I suggest you plug in TA as your target audience. Questions to consider: Is there a way to train TA's to be better faster more accurate graders by improving their ability to detect what went wrong in a students assignment? Is there a way to train them to have better diagnostic skills during piazza threads? Is there a tool that would help TA's trouble shoot student issues in a more efficient way.?"	8/30/2015 21:25	514		
Student51	Student56	1	"[firstname], it seems like you have a good understan[lastname]g and start to your project. One area you didn't mention that you might consider for Assignment 2 is provi[lastname]g more details about the format and the gra[lastname]g criteria of the Exams.

Student51	Student39	1	"[firstname]y, sounds like you have a good start to the semester. You have already started to touch on this but one area that stands out to me is: What benefits do you hope to deliver for the Teacher, the Student, the Parent and the School District. Even if your main focus is the teacher , the impact to the other four parties will be crucial to the success. I would also consider if you want to keep the final product focus on delivering the material to one student at a time, or a pair of students or a group of students. If you can deliver the material to more then one student and keep the same benefits you reduce the cost, because maybe you only need one device shared by four lab partners."	8/30/2015 22:19	847		
Student51	Student34	2	"[firstname], your write up is nice sweet and to the point. I wish I had it as a example before I wrote mine. I haven't taken 6505 so I can't give you much feedback specific to being a student. I do have one suggestion for your experiment you might consider asking for past students to volunteer instead of current students. They have already done the assignments and could resubmit their previous work for a Peer review experiment based on a single assignment. Since they have already taken the course you could do a before survey to see how the rate the normal experience. Then you could do a post survey to see if the peer feedback improved the survey results. Since you would be using students that have already taken the course, you wouldn't effect current students and you wouldn't have to time it with the current offering."	8/30/2015 22:42	661		
Student88	Student86	1	"I completely agree with you assessment at the end of the paper that the topic area is huge! You could go in many different directions with this. I think you kept coming back to your ini[firstname]l assumption (which I agree with) that implementing [lastname]e into a school district is incredibly difficult. That topic alone could be the subject of a study. However, I think your proposal of how to teach easily students is more interesting. This could give a roadmap to school districts around how to teach effectively and with limited impact. Like you, I to, need to work with my mentor to narrow down my topic area to help bound it. In doing so I think it will provide more direction for you to go research and dive into. Well done."	8/30/2015 21:30	347		
Student88	Student55	2	"Highly impressed by the research you have done thus far! As I was rea[lastname]g your paper I reflected on my two bachelor degrees and how different the advising was. One was 1-1 with an assigned professor, who would ask me what courses I would take next, give suggestions, ask how things were going, ask for feedback on our department's courses, etc. The other was done in email and unless something was going wrong, they didn't say much. My own experience with the OMS CS program is similar to what you recorded. It is primarily about determining what to take next. Also as you say, we have lots of options, in fact I dropped both classes I originally signed up for this semester in order to take this course and the Machine Learning for Tra[lastname]g course. It felt very s[lastname]ge doing that, but we have the flexibility to do so. Overall, your idea of buil[lastname]g some sort of automation or path or guide to helping other OMS CS students in their choice of classes is not only admirable, but do able. There are so many questions and opinions that keep coming up over and over and I think capturing these would help so many people (and deal with the scaling problem)."	8/30/2015 21:36	606		
Student88	Student82	1	"This is very interesting! I am curious if you have taken KBAI? Did you get a chance to collect and see all the exemplary work done there? If not, you should ask [firstname] for a copy of those from Spring. One thing I found is some of the work can be very, very different. Some is highly technical and very short. Others can be written in very plain terms, however is much longer. Another thing I have noticed is images and diagrams tend to help work get called out as exemplary. How might you deal with that? I had personally never heard or read about bigrams or unigrams, so this was very educational. I think you are on the right track and with your mentor should be able to come up with one very interesting project!"	8/30/2015 21:52	23	6	"Yes, and not only did I take the course I was a TA for it over summer. [firstname] has stated that the current IRB protocol should cover my use of old assignments. Images are something I admittedly am not planning on dealing with. I recognize that is a shortcoming, but I don't think I can realistically solve that problem this semester. My solution will focus only on written content. One basic solution I could put in, is convert the images to gray scale and count the number of pixels. The more pixels, presumably the more complex. I think that's as far as I would take it though. It'd be a great follow up project for another student. Thanks! I can't wait to share my results."
Student88	Misc3	1	"This was well broken out! I think you have shown you have spent plenty of time thinking about the various areas that you could go research and understand with respect to a student's effort in a course. I do agree with you that it is a bit broad. I think for example that the study of timing of how long a quiz or an assignment took a student alone could be a project for you. In fact, I had a CS professor who would time us and write down when each person finished. She never published her results, since she did not really get her permission, but her general rule was the folks who got As usually finished together, were never first and the folks who finished way after the average time always did poorly. I will be curious to see where you go next. Good luck!"	8/30/2015 21:53	338		
Student58	Student29	1	"Certainly an interesting idea. Do you think, if proven effective in teaching, this would make sense from a business perspective? The system makes sense in the current application I'd imagine due to the significant cost of doing a physical mock-up. When training technicians, is there a significant cost in training them on a real aircraft? When Microsoft announced Hololens it seemed like a really great tool for a similar application. Cheap, augmented reality systems could be very powerful teaching tools."	8/30/2015 21:44	420	6	
Student58	Student64	1	"If you were to create a dynamic pre-requisite tool, what other data would you want to collect? If the tool works well, additional information could be collected at a students application that could improve suggestions. The tool could also be important in the admissions process. If a student's data indicates they lack the pre-requisite skills for a significant number of classes, maybe they shouldn't be admitted."	8/30/2015 21:51	421	7	Thanks [firstname]. These are some areas on which I can focus.
Student58	Student5	1	"Did you find any information related to plagiarism in MOOCs vs traditional education? There has always been an issue in education with cheating, I wonder how it compares in a MOOC setting. The lack of oversight in some classes might be offset by the lack of student interaction. Easier cheating on assignments for online classes might be offset by the difficulty of cheating in a 1 on 1 proctored exam like many Georgia Tech classes. The big problem about research into academic dishonesty is the data only shows who gets caught. If the oversight in MOOCs is so bad that the cheating isn't even being tracked, research will be difficult."	8/30/2015 21:58	520		
Student58	Student87	1	VR and AR have a huge poten[firstname]l to influence education. What are you thinking of working on over the duration of the course. Scope for the project is important (I'm definitely having problems picking the appropriate sized project). Are you planning on buil[lastname]g a tool or doing research on the topic?	8/30/2015 22:07	1057		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student72	1	"Technology in Montessori is an interesting area/question to explore, but maybe could take anther tack: What is the evolved form of Montessori? Instead of questioning the fit of technology, you might start thinking of new methodology that extends and improves on Montessori. You could call it Techossori. :)"	8/30/2015 23:51	500	7	This is an interesting idea that actually sounds more exciting to explore than my original idea. I really like the idea of fin[lastname]g what is not being addressed well in Montessori curriculum and materials and creating software applications to meet those needs.
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student95	1	"[firstname], cool idea! I think you are right about kids not buil[lastname]g things. I can remember taking stuff apart and buil[lastname]g things in my garage from an early age, but my own kids did much less of that. I think much of this due to computer games, simulations, etc. The virtual world can give kids the feeling that they have created something (for example Minecraft), when in fact they have not. Working through trial and error until something works in the ""real world"" is a valuable skill that seems to be getting lost in the latest generations. So net is I love your idea to get kids buil[lastname]g stuff. The only question I have is this: There seem to a ton of sites with info on educational robots (example: http://tech.co/top-5-kids-educational-robots-ces-2015-2015-01). How will your project be different from these?"	8/30/2015 23:59	751		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student66	1	"[firstname], I like this idea of gamification in learning, and good to see you are interested in teaching kids programming. I think the root of this is to get kids to understand concepts that cross languages. I have been around for a while and programming paradigms come and go, and it seems the lifetime of any given language is getting shorter and shorter. Nevertheless I still use concepts I learned programming BASIC on TRS-80 back in the day, so I think the important thing is to get kids to see a tangible result quickly. Also, I'm not sure what age kids you are targeting, but if typing is slowing things down you might look at a graphical programming language like LabView from National Instruments (http://www.ni.com/labview/)."	8/31/2015 0:12	937		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student28	1	"[firstname], I think you opening paragraph is spot on. I have been the tech world for many years and also taught high school math, and I can attest to what you wrote there. It looks like you are having some trouble narrowing down a topic, or even selecting product vs. paper. Since design and automate tools for a living you are going to have great insight into what it takes to build working software project, and I'd recommend you try that route. Regar[lastname]g topic, take a look at the kinds of companies folks are starting up in the education space. Maybe that will give you some ideas. https://angel.co/education"	8/31/2015 0:27	635	7	Good to have reviewer's attestation to my summarized observations from his own experience. It's very helpful that he also provided additional resource to help in my quest.
Student40	Student25	1	"Hi [firstname], Your Assignment 01 submission was interesting it definitely brings up a few problematic areas that I'm trying to figure out/solve myself. The whole situation with the computer lab software and making that accessible via virtualization software is actually one that we're hoping to experiment with soon with some new hardware we just purchased to run a 2nd VDI project (the 1st one we did a few years ago wasn't successful due to performance issues). The comment about instructors continuing to use older software is another one that hits home too, because sometimes older software just gets abandoned even if the software still does a great job of getting the job done (e.g. instructors continue to use Easy Grade Pro 4.0 because they like its features, even though generally the campus has moved on to recommen[lastname]g usage of the Blackboard Grade Center. Another example is the occasional request for Frontpage). Just to share a few tools I've come across lately the past two years or so: there's one called Nitrous (https://www.nitrous.io) that provides a pretty complete online programming environment that simplifies things for students, and another system called Frame: (https://fra.me/) which provides a cloud VDI environment that is supposed to be usable for high-end graphics work in Autocad. We don't teach any Autocad courses at my workplace, but if we find the need to have better 3D graphics capabilities in our upcoming VDI environment, we're probably going to look into purchasing some of the new Nvidia cards specifically created for VDI (http://anandtech.com/show/9574/nvidia-announces-grid-20-tesla-m60-m6-grid-cards). While I work in IT at my college, since I also teach every other semester (and it's a PHP programming course to boot) it brings its own realizations of the problems that students run into trying to kickstart their learning process (and setting up the programming environment is a big hurdle). I'd love to hear more about the solution you're currently championing and look forward to the research you conduct! -[firstname]"	8/31/2015 0:18	1500	7	
Student40	Student42	1	"Hi Nick! Very interesting problem area to research into. One interesting variable I'd be curious about in the research (though I would doubt if there is any out there that's been conducted to measure this already) would be whether or not TV, or nowadays maybe simply the Internet, can play a positive role for a student from a lower socio-economic group (assuming the TV content isn't complete rubbish and that the students aren't just using the Internet to watch silly videos). Let me illustrate with some comments I've heard from others locally: I've heard commented before that the folks that have to go and stop by the homes of students that aren't in school typically see that the household has a big screen TV and some sort of cable/satellite system. Additionally, in a rural community like mine, high-speed Internet access is not always available, but where it is, it can also provide an entryway to a whole world of additional information for a student. When I was growing up though in those first formative years in the early 90s, I didn't have Internet then, but I can definitely speak to a lot of morals and lessons, and probably new vocabulary too, that I learned from watching cartoons (e.g. Duck Tales, Alad[lastname], Bobby's World, TMNT) or TV shows (like Family Matters, Home Improvement, Boy Meets World, etc.). Then as the 90s moved along towards the end there I got Internet access for the first time and it really did open up the world to me because there was just so much information out there and I could read and read for hours on end and learn new things. I bring this up, because I'm definitely curious if having all of these content sources (video/rea[lastname]g) available now are helping students from lower socio-economic groups poten[firstname]lly, even if the began their first 3 years with a large word gap at home. I couldn't find a link to the article (I think I remember rea[lastname]g it in one of my New Scientists issues a number of years ago), but there was one that came to mind as I was rea[lastname]g your Assignment 01, and I remember it mentioning something similar about the lower socio-economic group students having a disadvantage, but it also noted something along the lines of: the disadvantage only seemed to last until a certain age, upon which both groups of students were actually about equal). I wish I could point you to the article to see if it fits in. Sounds like an interesting project and I hope you are able to come up with some creative solutions on the chatbot/natural language processing side of things :-). -[firstname]"	8/31/2015 0:43	1216	6	"I'm sure that children's programming and Internet content makes a positive impact in students' acquisition of language and vocabulary, at least on a basic level. The only downside is that it doesn't provide the opportunity for interaction and complex questioning that having a conversation with an adult would, which is what we'd be hoping to accomplish with an intelligent agent."
Student40	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname]! I'm excited too :-). Artificial Intelligence as a topic is one that has definitely seemed pretty daunting for me, and I haven't taken KBAI either, but this course is certainly steering me towards it (I simply hope I'm prepared enough when I take it...I'm always worried that my limited math or algorithms background will negatively impact me, as it did in CS-6505). It was definitely interesting to learn a little bit more about Intelligent Tutoring Systems this week too. Your idea about provi[lastname]g mentors for OMSCS students was kind of interesting to me. It made me imagine a system where instead of Piazza, a similar tool was used that would be under the control of Udacitiy or Georgia Tech, which would allow the database to be directly accessible. Assuming privacy wasn't an issue, it would then be interesting to mine the database of all of the comments / interactions students have with each other on the discussion threads and somehow use that information to provide mentoring/partner recommendations, along with other types of suggestions/information that might be useful to students. (I guess this is in a way how Facebook works...since they have access to all of the interactions between so many people, they can mine that information and use it to provide recommendations, ad placements, etc.). Looking forward to see how your thoughts develop over the coming weeks! -[firstname]"	8/31/2015 1:03	572	6	
Student40	Student79	1	"Hi [firstname]! Very interesting project idea...learning another language is on so many people's bucket list :-). I too have heard of Duolingo, though while I might have the app on my phone I don't think I've really ever used it. But I have heard good things about it. I've also used a bit of Rosetta Stone too, but it was always difficult to be consistent with using it and learning a language. One interesting thing that I thought of as I was rea[lastname]g your Assignment 01 was a book I purchased a few years back when I was looking into learning a bit of Russian. The primary reason I purchased the book was because on every page it had both the English and Russian versions of the text, which I always thought would be kind of neat (again though, a lack of time and consistency meant that I only read a few pages out of the book). Another thought that came up to me, was the feeling of how it's so much easier to learn a foreign language when you're being immersed in it (such as when someone goes into a study abroad program, or moves to a foreign country). It would be neat if there were tools out there that could immerse you in a foreign language, even though you're still working/living wherever you might be in the US :-). Something like Google Glass or Hololens might even provide ways for this to happen by automatically showing visual [lastname]slations of text you see in your daily life on the fly (therefore integrating it more into your regular day and provi[lastname]g some immersion). And then maybe eventually we'll have one of these Learning Machines available described in Battlefield Earth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUzrSAGJW6k (or another example would be the way Neo learned in the Matrix). Once we can crack how to [lastname]sfer information directly into a brain it'll probably be a very interesting [lastname]e for the world :-).

Student61	Student51	2	Sounds like you have a great problem. I love the Appendix!! It clearly organizes your research for reference later and plan to emulate it.	8/31/2015 8:21	235		
Student61	Student92	2	"I love this problem! IN fact it sounds similar to the intelligent tutor I would like to build. Sooo I have lots of questions; How do you plan to use different characteristics/capabilities of different languages? Have you read Dr. Joyner's paper about the 5 different roles of an teacher? How would your tutor recognize what the student needs to work on? Would it be web, local system, app based? There are a lot of great papers on Intelligent Tutors in the resources. I am excited to see what you come up with! Let me know if you plan to do a group project or join one!!"	8/31/2015 8:25	782		
Student61	Student41	2	"Sounds like you are proposing a hybrid research and design project. I am fascinated by your idea of an M-learning framework but it sounds like you need to define with research what the industry stakeholders want. The more I think about it the less I feel you have to do research. In fact I believe if you design your framework so that authors have to limit teaching segments into ""chunking"" it may progress naturally into a tool the industry could use and adopt. Great Idea, I am looking forward to see what you develop!!!"	8/31/2015 8:38	575		
Student61	Student83	1	Both problems sound like great starts!! DO you think it is possible to teach general diagnostic skill without knowns the body of knowledge of a subject in order to identify what your knowledge shortfall may be? Sounds like a both problems could benefit from a design project that could diagnose a students lack of knowledge in a particular body of knowledge. Is this possible without having a library of the desired aspects involved in the knowledge base? Would a system like this damp students self exploration? I look forward to seeing what you decide to pursue!!!	8/31/2015 8:47	563		
Student22	Student71	2	"Hi [firstname], I think both areas of interest are worthy ideas and insightful (I have seen both of these problems in my personal experience). 1. Knowledge [lastname]sfer has always been problematic I agree - I have been on both sides of the equation ""caller and call-ee"". I must agree the written material sometimes is not adequate to cover what a person really does in their job even with screen shots - there is usually something missing ( a critical piece that was so obvious to the person writing the documentation that they never considered writing it down). A tool to make knowledge [lastname]sfer more consistent would help alleviate that. 2. Anything we can provide disadvantaged people knowledge to use the internet or other computer tools is a worthy goal. Having some of that easily available on a cell phone and the like would be nice. While there are tutorials on many things (think YouTube) - its hit and miss with quality and you don't what to trust or pick from - a consistent quality checked series of videos would be nice."	8/31/2015 8:52	831	7	"It helps getting feedback like this as it validates my premise that current tools aren't always simple to use to produce the desired result. When looking at an iOS app for an iPad (or even a phone) to be useful in knowledge [lastname]sfer, the thought is to provide a build method that is consistent, easy to use, and provides a result that the student can gain from without getting lost in ""dead space"" of an over done video or have critical points missing in a rush job. Not sure that can be met, but as I read feedback like this, I think of even more ""problem definition"" items that hopefully we can find a resolution for."
Student22	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	2	"Hi Kamran, Good paper and you hit upon many good topics - blended teaching may work for some but not others - and is difficult to measure. Visual versus hands-on it hard to do determine too without instructor/student interaction. I also know that teachers are under a time crunch and budgets so they often have to go the easier route out of pure necessity. Measuring learning is a good goal, I think you have a good foundation for the course."	8/31/2015 9:06	330		
Student22	Student15	2	"Hi [firstname], Well stated! Fin[lastname]g appropriate content has always been difficult with the internet - while keyword searches are fine - you often get things you don't want (or only par[firstname]lly relevant) - hence you spend more time searching and par[firstname]lly rea[lastname]g/viewing content only to find its not what you want. Having a consistent tagging mechanism would help this, but it must be consistent I think to work. Off-hand being a programmer myself I don't see how you can do discovery of content (beyond key words and phrases) but perhaps you have a better idea as you have given it more thought. Seem like a good project to pursue."	8/31/2015 9:12	357		
Student22	Student80	2	"Hi Student80, Well thought out paper in my opinion, I never really thought about Game Theory combined with group projects and individual testss. Although in retrospect I have noticed this kind of behavior in the real world, and you have a number of considerable references already. The student crossover problem may possibly be avoid by having a double blind study of students? As far as students are concerned maybe ask for course volunteers. The only problem is that they are contributing to your project instead of their own (as you mention) so they might not be so inclined to particpate timely or consistently - a system of extra credit no matter how small would help - but I think that would be [lastname]ing the game now that the class has started."	8/31/2015 13:25	12	5	I wonder if there is research on participation. IRB probably has something to say.
Student1	Student54	1	"This is a great topic to research. As more degree seeking programs become online only, new cheating detection and prevention processes are needed. One other thing you might want to include in your research is why students actively choose to cheat. Is it laziness, a lack of understan[lastname]g of the material, or desperation? Could there be improvements in the course content/teacher side of the equation to discourage cheating by offering more help to struggling students? Just my two cents."	8/31/2015 9:55	313		
Student1	Student60	1	"This is an interesting problem to study. One aspect you might want to research is how your solution would work for different demographics, say 18-24 year-olds vs 25-40 year-olds who typically have different demands on their time outside of learning in a MOOC."	8/31/2015 10:02	199	7	Thanks for the feedback. Definitely got a fresh idea to consider.
Student1	Student10	1	This is a really great concept!

Student1	Student47	1	"This is a really good area to study. As a former high school teacher, I suggest you might want to consider how your system would work differently for younger children (5-12) and teenagers (13-18) because what motivates one group to behave is different from the other."	8/31/2015 10:14	123		
Student60	Student87	1	"I really liked the idea and its really exciting to see what you would come up with. Although, I understand that this is a pretty ini[firstname]l idea at this point and as you progress you idea will be clearer of what you would come up with, but the idea in general is very promising. I agree with you that the possibilities are endless and there is lots to look around and zero on an idea. Will be looking forward to what you come up with."	8/31/2015 9:59	1183		
Student60	Student33	1	"I really liked the idea of utilizing interactive games to teach kids. I think, the idea is really exciting.

Student60	Student58	1	I really liked your idea. And I agree that there is a definite need of an intelligent hint sub-system for intelligent tutoring system.

Best of luck to you.	8/31/2015 10:26	534	5	"Nice, positive feedback."

Student17	Student81	1	"Hi [firstname], I found your research topic very interesting! It would be very interesting to see the viability of hololens and similar technologies in the use of education.

Student17	Student96	1	"Hi [firstname], the resources you have are great! I think it would be interesting to provide stronger training videos to end-users rather than have designers teach them. It could possibly cut down on the amount of person-to-person support required. On the other hand, this may prove challenging to end-users that aren't as sufficient and would much rather prefer a real person helping them. It might be interesting to have a discussion forum for questions from designers as well, similar to Piazza. This would eliminate or reduce the number of redundant or repeated questions asked by designers."	8/31/2015 10:44	561	7	
Student17	Student35	1	"Hi [firstname], this is a very intriguing topic. I am most curious to how you would justify the use of your metric for interpreting individual contributions in a software engineering team. Of course, as you mentioned something like the number of git commits would be insufficient. Additionally, I do not see the number of lines coded working well as a metric either, because co[lastname]g more lines does not necessarily mean uphol[lastname]g a good code quality. However, a tool like the one that you're describing would undoubtedly help with scaling in a program like OMSCS's. It might turn out to be more trouble than its worth if the tool is not thoroughly built or has many bugs/defects. Looking forward to what you come up with!"	8/31/2015 11:40	1175	6	"Thank you for the positive feedback! You correctly point that it may turn out to be more trouble if the tool is not built throughly. However, I believe the challenge can be effectively met if the platform's architecture allows for customization and extension. I plan to talk about the proposed architecture, and how it can help meet the underlying goals, in the upcoming assignments."
Student17	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], I think that it's a great idea to use a single window for consolidating Udacity, T-Square, and Piazza. In fact, before I had started the OMSCS, I imagined that this would be done, sort of like a gatech universal experience platform. Now I realize that that would have been a major undertaking and required a lot of legwork to create. I'm looking forward to seeing your web application which would undoubtedly help organization among students in the OMSCS program!"	8/31/2015 12:59	3974		
Student94	Student63	1	Good write up on intelligent tutor using ANDES. I was confused as to what ANDES is. Is it a research on how to develop a physics tutor and your goal is to create that tool? Or a tool already exists and yours will be doing something similar.	8/31/2015 10:26	933		
Student94	Student78	1	"This is an interesting topic to identify the different styles of learning and be able to link them to particular users. One question would be how long would the system take to identify the learning style of a user to help them intelligently solve problems? I would like to know how such intelligent systems work, look forward to what you find."	8/31/2015 10:59	1210		
Student94	Student65	1	Certainly a lot of topics to explore under intelligent systems. Hopefully you will eventually get a clearer picture from research this week so you can narrow it down eventually.	8/31/2015 11:19	485	6	
Student94	Student53	1	"In terms of user adoption are you expecting to see something different from the graph by Rogers? or you are planning to [lastname]e something about the current process of adopting business applications? That was not clear. Good paper, I would like to see how this paper progresses."	8/31/2015 11:27	617		
Student98	Student18	1	Liked how you considered the cultural aspect in the paper. It will be interesting to see the comparisons from one culture to another culture. Many other cultures might have similar problems as well.	8/31/2015 13:40	330	4	
Student98	Student4	0	"I was expecting to see one issue to be resolved for the project and not just a brainstorm of ideas. Although the ideas were interesting, I didn't get a clear picture of what direction you are headed in and how you plan to solve the problem."	8/31/2015 13:45	536		
Student98	Student49	1	"Interesting topic. I agree that an app can help engage the senior employees with projects involving emerging technologies. Maybe the game can help drive the passion back into their lives. Kind of curious of why they are not engaged and lack passion in the beginning. I think if the game incorporates excitement and laughter, it will create a spark to want to learn more material and keep playing the game."	8/31/2015 13:54	595		
Student98	Student3	1	Great write-up. Liked the use of the many resources and facts. The format and layout of the information made the paper strong and clearly defined.	8/31/2015 14:04	303	5	"The other peer feedback I received indicated the my problem was not clear. However, this feedback is opposite. This contradiction forces me to improve the readability of the problem so that anyone without prior knowledge of the subject may read the paper."
Student77	Student12	1	"Interesting problem area--I'd love to see some of this backed up by citation to existing research (it will definitely be helpful later on when we're writing research papers to have a thorough literature review completed).

Student77	Student101	1	"I'd love to hear specific instances of when a ""lack of knowledge on how to operate and or knowing the terminology associated with the technology they are using."" Is it that students don't understand key CS concepts like compiling, etc? Or is it more basic than that? I had a lot of questions around this challenge, and it would be good if you could explicitly outline it for your reader! Clearly defining this problem would also help me give feedback on your idea of using video--for example, if its terminology that [lastname]es frequently (>1 yearly), then video could be a cumbersome system to maintain and update. Overall good start! Looking forward to rea[lastname]g more about what you're doing in Piazza."	8/31/2015 13:52	216	7	
Student77	Student59	1	"Very well defined project area, I'm interested to see what you develop here.

Also might be worth chatting with some existing HS teachers and students to see where the gaps really are--as consumers of online courses, you and I might have ideas about what we prefer, but we're also not 14 year olds! Make sure you're tailoring the curriculum to existing needs, not perceived needs!"	9/3/2015 13:16	202	6	I agree that I should cite more existing literature.

Student35	Student77	1	"Hello, [firstname], You have done a good job outlining why and how a different concept and tool, in lieu of contemporary discussion forums, can be useful to students. It seems to me that one of your goals is to tackle the signal-to-noise ratio in discussions and have all the expert knowledge in a place where students can access it irrespective of where they are and what courses they are taking. Stackoverflow does a very good job at it, indeed. But as you may know, the focus of Stackoverflow is not discussion, but expert opinion. Questions that lead to long opinionated discussions or debates (as opposed to facts) are not encouraged on Stackoverflow, whereas the main use case for discussion boards is opinion sharing. It seems to me that this factor might have some implications for your project, in that it might be important to distinguish between the goals of improving factual learning and ""in-class discussion"". The latter seems to be a broad and undefined goal (although having a standard place for Q&As can also improve discussions), unlike your main idea or proposal. I look forward to seeing how your concepts evolve and any implementation artifacts. Thanks, [firstname]"	8/31/2015 16:51	2769		
Student35	Student81	0	"It is interesting to learn about the Microsoft HoloLens project, [firstname]. It does seem that the product (as a wearable technology) could be very useful in ""guide and support maintenance"" situations. I do have a few (relatively minor) concerns: The submission mentions that for some situations, ""time is of the essence."" However, the mentioned situations appear to be one-off incidents -- like that of a remote expert offering support in an emergency-only situation. If that impression is correct, wouldn't this use case be somewhat like, discounting the emergency factor, the instance of a software technician offering technical support over remote desktop sharing technology to an end-user regar[lastname]g an Internet Explorer browser issue? This product or idea, then, does not seem to a good fit for an educational technology (although the end user might learn a thing or two about IE in the troubleshooting session). Or do you envision these troubleshooting sessions to be part of a knowledge base? Or, are these technologies supposed to become a part of learning modules? For example, are you envisioning that students in remote, combative environments will be going through training modules on a regular basis? In summary, it might be a good idea to explicitly list the concrete use cases (not just the theme) in your project proposal. The statement would have also benefitted from a bibliography or references section. Some product description sentences in Paragraph 3 should have been cited for the reviewer's benefit. I look forward to rea[lastname]g your research about applying wearable technology to remote learning situations."	8/31/2015 18:48	3765	7	Thanks for the recommendations. I will look into ad[lastname]g concrete examples and avoid mixing the use case descriptions.
Student35	Student96	0	"From rea[lastname]g this essay, I understand that you are interested in ""community based learning"", but I'm still not clear on what concrete tools are you going to build, or how existing tools have failed to do the job for you, or whether you're just thinking about ad[lastname]g educational features to your website-buil[lastname]g software. There's a mention of buil[lastname]g a ""learning management system"", ""training/support/analysis tool"", ""instrumented version that tracks specific usage"". However, learning management systems already exist and so do a wide variety of ""granular"" statistics/usage tracking software. At a high level, how do these existing systems fail to meet your training or teaching goals? In summary, the uses cases in the statement could have been more specific. That said, best of luck on your project!"	8/31/2015 20:26	1737	3	"I can't tell if this feedback is just jarring or if it is useful. Perhaps I just misunderstood the assignment and described a community that I would like to implement some sort of solution to and the feedback indicates that I should be describing a tool or proposed solution. For example, it mentions that Learning Management Systems already exist (in fact I have built one) but the community that I would like to try to help hasn't used one and therefore it could be helpful to them."
Student35	Student12	1	"Creating an agent that teaches a foreign language is a great goal. I'm not sure, though, if your idea has already been not implemented in some mobile app (or in Rosetta Stone, e.g.); or how feasible it is to learn all about speech recognition and NLP in a semester. I'm also not sure if a project with such an ambitious goal could be developed or even investigated fully in a semester's timeframe. It might be a good idea, therefore, to focus on a manageable subset of the problem -- e.g., creating an agent that just teaches counting in German. Minor suggestions for improving the essay: the document would have benefitted from some proof rea[lastname]g; having it in PDF would have been more helpful, as well. Overall, your idea sounds great and I look forward to learning more about your work."	8/31/2015 20:55	1458	6	
Student71	Student99	2	"I really like your layout of the assignment, very organized and purposeful. I wish I had been able to see an example like this before doing my own. Not having an educator background, it seems even more difficult to innovate in ed tech for someone like myself. I think something like this as a go to guide for a class like this could be a very interesting concept."	8/31/2015 17:56	410	6	
Student71	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"This seems like it could be a pretty difficult, but doable, problem to resolve. You'll probably want a good division of work amongst a project team to meet your goals. Coor[lastname]ation for that might be complex. I can definitely see where an iOS app of some kind might be able to provide a visual, kinesthetic and logic based approach for the same lesson. Creating that solution should be an exciting challenge."	8/31/2015 18:03	970		
Student71	Student15	2	"I love this idea, assuming I'm understan[lastname]g it correctly. I'm not quite sure how you might determine the usage of content in learning contexts for the tagging, at least not without some sort of ""polling"" mechanism (which might undermine the autonomous goal), but perhaps a little bit of AI can be involved in ""speculating"" the possible use cases of the results pulled along with a learning algorithm to assign probability to the use cases."	8/31/2015 18:19	916		
Student71	Student80	2	"Admittedly I had to read it a few times to get the gist. This is some fascinating stuff. One suggestion would be to ensure the group projects are component driven. Each member of a the group has a completely separate component that must be complete for the whole to work. However, also have a ""rubric"" for each component available to swap into the submitted projects to ensure the other components work, regardless of the effort of each individual in the group. That way if someone one bails on the challenge and gets it, you know...""mostly right"" because of lack of follow through (I suppose ability as well), that could be compared to results in surveys and games. I don't know if that model works as it could poison the experiment if people know that their piece won't be picked up by someone else."	8/31/2015 18:34	1632	5	"I'm curious what was unclear, so I can improve that next time."
Student81	Student77	2	"This looks very interesting. Computer Supported Collaborative Work is a key to what I like to call social learning and this concept extends beyond one on one. It is true that most times we are driven by questions, ""How to I fix this?"" ""How to I build that?"" ""How do xyz?"" but sometimes we stumble across knowledge for the sake of knowledge. I look forward to hearing more about how you may address some of the challenges facing the MOOC model"	8/31/2015 17:48	898		
Student81	Student12	1	"This is an interesting topic. After rea[lastname]g your paper I actually have more questions than comments. But that is not really a bad thing. You have succeeded in getting me to think about this. Have you looked at google [lastname]slate and incorporating best of breed technology that already exists such as the vast resources of Rosetta Stone? When looking at new languages, how does the person leverage technology different that what is already available? The learning of a new language and challenges you present certainly has peeked my interest. I look forward to seeing how this research unfolds."	8/31/2015 18:04	1106	6	
Student81	Student101	1	I think that we can all use better ways to learn. Researching this is certainly valuable and I look forward to following your progress.	8/31/2015 18:23	172	6	
Student81	Student68	2	This is clearly a master's degree level research effort. I am really impressed with the concept and the detail you have already presented. My only recommendation is that you watch the scope. There poten[firstname]l to get too deep in the research and get lost in the details. I am sure this will result in a paper that is worthy of academic publishing	8/31/2015 18:27	486		
Student86	Student55	2	"Wow, great write up. I like the way you've gathered data for your research so far. You've done a extensive amount of rea[lastname]g on this topic , that shows in this report. As with me, You have also realized that more we get closer to the topic of our interest, we realize that the problem domain is much bigger than what we originally anticipated. I hope you will be able to narrow down to the specific sub topic that you will be doing the research in next 2-3 weeks. Looking forward for your final research content. wish you all the best."	8/31/2015 18:13	216		
Student86	Student37	1	"Wow, You've chosen a existing problem in places and a very creative solution that you have come up with. Very interesting research and I am glad you've narrowed down your area of research ( I have not narrowed down the section of my research yet). All the best and I can't wait to see the final research content at the end of this course."	8/31/2015 22:34	584		
Student86	Student82	1	Great idea. Manually gra[lastname]g the papers are always a challenge based on my experience as a teaching assistant in a online course. The problem and the idea that you've presented here are really interesting . But I believe processing and comparing the thought vectors between the exemplary answers and a given answer can become a complex problem at times. I can't wait to see the research content of this paper at the end of the course. All the best.	8/31/2015 22:53	854	6	Thanks! I'm looking forward to learning as much about the topic as I can.
Student86	Misc3	2	"It a real problem in the online learning that no one really knows what is the level of understan[lastname]g the student has obtained while the lesson is progressing. In the real world classes, the teachers might get a visual cues on the students level of understan[lastname]g that can help them to direct a specialized guidance towards the individual student. Though it is a complex problem to resolve in the online education environments, I liked the way you've dissected the problem and some great ideas to do further research. All the best and I can't wait to see your final research content at the end of the course. TH"	8/31/2015 23:39	102		
Student79	Student35	1	"The first paragraph could be a lot simpler. Something like, ""I will develop a platform for evaluating individual student contributions in team software projects."" Very interesting idea. I think it might be a little too ambitious to accomplish in one semester, but certainly worth it if you are able to. It looks like you already have some research done. One thought I have is the distinction between a good software engineer in industry versus school. While the overall goal is to produce engineers that do a good job in industry, many classes need to focus on particular sub goals. Error handling, api-definitions, style guidelines, may not always be the best measure of success in a class setting, but I would not hire an engineer I didn't feel would do a good job in those areas. Different classes often have different goals and different metrics. I think it would be good to get some feedback from a variety of software courses on what criteria they are looking for in assignments. Good luck!"	8/31/2015 19:27	1064	5	Thank you for the positive feedback on the idea! The point about the need to reconcile different perspectives was discussed at a few places in the statement.
Student79	Student73	1	"This is a very do-able project and I would be very happy to use the results. I agree that much of this is disorganized. I would like it very much if it also included registration tools -- I find registering for classes one of the worst flow I could think of. For this to truly be a success, however, I think you will need to coor[lastname]ate with any efforts already in process. Many of these interfaces may already be [lastname]ing and it would be easy for an interface on top of these to quickly grow stale. It should also be easily configurable and quick to update. While on the surface, it seems your project may be a limited focus, if you are able to make it simple enough it could still be a significant contribution to the success of the OMSCS program."	9/2/2015 18:55	529	6	
Student79	Student17	1	"You goal seems laudable and I tend to agree with your analysis about lack of competition. I'm not quite sure how technology will help introduce competition within the education environment. It seems more a political problem than any. I think if you can break through and in some way add competition, this could be a real game [lastname]er. But I'm afraid your project might just be another tool to try to teach kids. I find that most of these tools take more time and resources than their benefits."	9/2/2015 19:20	275		
Student79	Student25	1	"This seems very ambitious and requires quite a bit of hardware. It would be helpful to have an idea of what resources will be needed before committing to such a project. Other than ""training"" I find that most education uses gen[firstname] resources and relies on on-the-job training. That is, I never used Visual Studio in college, but quickly learned what I needed once in the professional realm. This was not a limiting factor, but I think forces the instructors to generalize more. -- But maybe I'm being a little too opinionated :)"	9/2/2015 19:29	325		
Student53	Student1	1	"Hi Sam, The assignment looks good, I like the focus, very likely part of the solution will be the ITS you mentioned. One thing I would add to question 2. is cost, are you considering that both the in-seat and online cost the same? That is, if someone drops out of the online or in-seat do they lose the same amount of money? I think that is an important factor, dropping out of free Coursera, Udacity courses is so easy because they are free, and that is the same cause that people join without a real commitment sometimes. My only feedback in regards to the assignment is that the problem was implicitly stated at the beginning, it was till the end where I got a clear idea. In the ""Next Steps"" section is where it was more clear that the problem was ""online courses having a lower completion rate than in-seat""."	8/31/2015 19:45	975	6	
Student53	Student78	1	"Hi [firstname], the ITS is an interesting topic. It seems to involve a lot of AI and Machine Learning. It would be interesting to have this system being trained by actual people feedback. Something like a machine generating the feedback and then a tutor fixing/evaluating it before it is sent, through time then the system could become intelligent enough."	8/31/2015 20:01	1452		
Student53	Student63	2	"Hi Yi-Chen, this assignment is very well structured. You state the phenomenon first and then the specifics on how this will apply to your poten[firstname]l project. The references are really good, basing your project off/on top of ANDES gives you a big leap into developing a good idea. I look forward to your fin[lastname]gs. PS: Probably some autocorrect error in the title, it says: Aissiment."	8/31/2015 20:26	794		
Student53	Student97	1	"HI [firstname], this looks like a good start. I think that doing this for Information Security brings opportunities to implement a system that uses unconventional ways to educate. I can imagine a game that helps learn the concepts through solving different puzzles / challenges and maybe a point based system to evaluate the students learning. Btw, the outcome of your project could poten[firstname]lly help enhance the Intro to Info Security course in our program."	8/31/2015 20:39	876	5	
Student54	Student33	0	"It sounds like you are off to a good start at narrowing down your project proposal. May I suggest looking for suitable partners within the class, as you stated, there are are some similar projects in the works. Combining your skill sets with others sounds like a winning move to me."	8/31/2015 21:12	2461	7	
Student54	Student60	1	"I like your well thought out paper. Automating groups sounds like an interesting problem space and doable in a semester. There are many ways to form a group (related interests, forced group, demographically/timezone, etc) there are a lot of other options to consider too. Also, with retention rates as low as they are for MOOCs in general, it may be appropriate to have the reformation of groups later in the ""semester"". Interesting problem, I look forward to hearing/rea[lastname]g more about it in Piazza."	8/31/2015 21:53	386	7	The feedback was well described and motivating too.
Student54	Student10	1	"Learning a new language is an interesting problem. I have a limited understan[lastname]g of the issue, so I don't know if I can offer any advice. However, I've heard it said that immersion is ideal for language learning. While I was rea[lastname]g your paper, I had a few thoughts. I believe interaction between native speakers would be interesting. For example, create a [firstname]etplace where native Mandarin, speakers (who want to learn English) are paired up with native English speakers (who want to learn Mandarin,). And let them form friendships, chatting, talking, whatever. Good luck with your project!"	8/31/2015 21:59	369	7	Great feedback - the thought has definitely crossed my mind!
Student54	Student47	1	I like your well thought out paper. Disruptive classroom behavior sounds like an interesting problem to tackle. And using gamification to solve it is very interesting. There is a lot of data that can be captured as a result of that approach. It would be very interesting to monitor/research the effectiveness of different approaches. Good luck!	8/31/2015 22:06	181		
Student19	Student93	2	"Let me start by admitting that I was not very aware about the implications of narcolepsy until I read your reflection. Amazing job! I was able to clearly understand the problem and even poten[firstname]l implementations for the solutions you are thinking about. Clearly your paper should be featured as exemplary work. I'm not sure how much help I can give for something I know so little about, but keep up being descriptive and using visual aids. I'm looking forward to what you come up with by the end of the course."	8/31/2015 22:03	10	7	It is very helpful to know that even people without prior knowledge of narcolepsy were able to follow the paper.
Student19	Student74	1	I have't seen video modeling before. This is a great tool. A poten[firstname]l issue that would be nice to address is how to educate teachers on using the mobile app properly? I really like the idea of incorporating ResearchKit or similar tools.	8/31/2015 22:03	1780		
Student19	Student75	1	"I really like that you have a specific idea in mind. I'm not familiar with the linear programming engine, I think it would be beneficial for the reader to include a reference to it. I definitely would use a tool that helps me plan my schedule :-)"	8/31/2015 22:33	1004	5	"Yes, there are many LP (linear programming) engine API in the open source [firstname]et but Gurobi and GLPK are the best ones as optimizer tool. Thanks!"
Student19	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	This was definitely an interesting take on educational technology. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g about your experiences and how technology is not always the answer. I'm interested to see where you take this from here. Maybe provide a framework to assess whether or not a piece of software is needed. Really great read!	8/31/2015 22:49	899	6	
Student6	Student61	1	"I like the idea and I agree that you will likely only be able to focus on one or two programming languages. Are you considering something like a plugin framework for the agent? Along the lines of a language registering that it needs to teach concepts X, Y, and Z, so it makes the necessary information available to the agent. Opening up a well designed framework to the community via open-source would allow you to have people create the content necessary for other language support. Good luck!"	9/1/2015 2:59	550	6	Great idea to make it an open-source framework!!
Student6	Student11	0	"I enjoyed rea[lastname]g about your many different ideas. It appears that you may have many different project options ahead of you. However, I found the layout of the document distracting; there was very little difference between the Hea[lastname]g 2 style and the Hea[lastname]g 3 Style. The hea[lastname]gs as chosen did not fit with what I was expecting in this assignment. I was expecting fewer ideas and more information about how you researched a smaller set of ideas. I don't feel that you go into any detail with where you are in regards to your current level of knowledge of the area, and how you plan on addressing those gaps in your knowledge. Good luck!"	9/1/2015 3:09	857		
Student6	Student70	1	"I like the idea that you have, and I agree, it will be challenging. What I was hoping to see in the document was a more thorough discussion of what you know of the problem area, and how you plan to address any areas where you need to learn more about the subject matter. Is the idea that you would have a ranking of the blog compared to other blogs, or would you only have the agent assess a site upon user demand? Good luck!"	9/1/2015 3:23	341	6	
Student6	Student45	1	"Jazz, I love the positive energy that you bring to the program overall. It comes through very strongly in your assignment. I can relate to the desire to give back to the overall community. I didn't see anything in your document about what areas you have been researching to help you make a decision on which project you will undertake. I know that researching my poten[firstname]l subject area has helped me to narrow down a decision as to what I am going to undertake this summer, maybe that will help you as well. I look forward to seeing what you produce come December. Good luck!"	9/2/2015 3:22	440	6	
Student78	Student54	1	I like that you have been working on an applicable product. You will probably get a lot from this class. Very well written paper and I found the topic of integrity interesting.	9/1/2015 7:26	174		
Student78	Student63	1	You stated the problem well... I too am interested in intelligent tutoring systems for any subject. Do you think that identifying how a student learns best (what methods of teaching) is important?	9/1/2015 7:29	219		
Student78	Student97	1	Great job being very specific about what questions need to be answered and basic start to how you wish to proceed. Good luck this semester.	9/1/2015 7:33	85		
Student78	Student1	2	I too am interested in ITS solutions. I also think that keeping a student engaged is important and that along with any ITS solutions peer interaction would be an important component. The feeling of being completely on your own in an online class and the lack of that constant peer interaction that is seen in in-seat classes may explain a lot of the dropout rate difference. I really liked your train of though here and wish you good luck this semester :)	9/1/2015 7:34	182	7	
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student93	2	Outstan[lastname]g development of towards your thesis. Probably the best paper I've read in this class so far. Using technology to make learning and Education more acccessible to those with disabilities is one of the most admirable pursuits I can think of.	9/1/2015 8:47	130	6	"well, yeah - I am awesome :)"
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student88	2	"I am impressed that you are asking yourself the same kinds of questions traditional teachers ask themselves. I think this is crucial -- to apply technology to enhance and facilitate traditional pedagogy, rather than attempt to revolutionize it. Good work."	9/1/2015 8:49	98		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student86	1	Some suggestions towards your topic: research the use of the LOGO programming language in elementary schools in the 1980s. The Microsoft Technology Associate program has full curriculum that teachers can use to learn and teach programming. Just some suggestions. Best of luck on your project!	9/1/2015 8:51	135		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student55	2	"Fascinating idea and very well-researched for such a preliminary stage. I believe one of the biggest problems we have in the area of advising is lack of staffing for peak periods -- how can we hire professional, full-time employees to meet peak demand, without being too wasteful of funds the rest of the semester. The use of technology might be able to help create solutions towards the resolution of these issues."	9/1/2015 8:53	960		
Student37	Student7	1	"Seems like you're on the right track. You have a clear plan of attack! Good luck! As for problem based learning that does not require an instructor, think about an automated hint system or something your users can click when they get stuck and get some insight that might solve their dilemma"	9/1/2015 13:00	484		
Student37	Student85	2	"[firstname]rdly there is a second blank page? Anyway, great job describing the problem that is prevalent all over our educational system. Hopefully your small solution can be built up by much bigger parties with bigger stakes to solve it."	9/1/2015 13:10	99		
Student37	Student20	2	"Peer feedback made me download this as a .zip file and open it for a word doc. I'm guessing PDF is just better for this. But anyway, good read. Really interesting. Shame on you for calling Math Blaster Lame. That was legit. But I agree, everyone is more used to technology now, and children tend to mature faster now, they're aware that Rea[lastname]g Rabbit is a crummy-rea[lastname]g alternative to angry birds. There are many other low-effort means of entertainment that they have access too on their parents phones and stuff, so your alternative proposed method should be more effective."	9/1/2015 13:12	285		
Student37	Student21	2	"I love this. Its very meta, and as a fellow student having taken THOSE SAME CLASSES... I understand the pain. Lots of these problems come down to instructor responsibility though: han[lastname]g out broken VMs and not actually testing their assignment adjustments. If nothing else, your solution at least would get those problems out of the way before the class began. Because yes, nobody tests something until its supposed to work. So if its supposed to work before the class.... success!"	9/1/2015 13:18	135		
Student18	Student6	1	Hi [firstname] Your idea of using simulation based learning model for training new employees looks really interesting. My project idea is very different from yours and during my search I have not come across any source that will be helpful to you. Though I checked our course library and it contains plenty of resources on Simulation Based Learning. I don�t have any knowledge about linear accelerators either but have you given a thought on using Microsoft Kinect to capture real life 3D models of objects for your project. I guess 3D scanning can be used to create linear accelerator simulations for training material.	9/1/2015 14:49	1634	5	"While not relevant to my project, the idea of trying to tie in MS Kinect in a simulation is an inspired one, and not something that I likely would have thought of."
Student18	Student11	1	Hi Vu [lastname] You have so many really good ideas. The idea which I liked most is Software Development/Online application. I agree with you and I also do feel the same. We are using many tools in OMS program and they create a sense of disconnect between educators and learners. So my vote goes to your online project idea.	9/1/2015 15:40	91		
Student18	Student70	1	Hi [firstname] You have an amazing idea. I never knew there exist anything like validating and certifying a blog. I can only think of some rating system for blog posts based on visitors� feedback. My project is very different than yours and I didn�t find any material in my search that will be helpful to you. Well good luck to your project.	9/1/2015 16:03	77	6	
Student18	Student45	1	"Hi [firstname] All your ideas are really great but the idea which I liked most is your note taking idea. I do agree with you that notes come very handy and make life very easy during exams. When I think of your idea two project directions come to my mind. First, Public notes � a wiki like notes that are shared and maintained by all students. One way to do this could be to attach a wiki with each lecture video where students could edit and maintain their notes. Second, Personal notes � one way to allow students to take notes easily is to display [lastname]scripts along with the video. When a student finds that a certain part in the lecture is important, it could highlight the part of [lastname]script displayed along the video. A screen capture option could also be provided along with highlight part. The system will then take all these highlighted parts from [lastname]script and can generate useful notes for the students for each video. Student could then further edit them as they wish."	9/4/2015 10:30	131	6	Great ideas!
Student41	Student56	1	"This sounds like a very interesting topic to tackle. The challenges you've already recognized are valid. Your second challenge whe[lastname] students are expected to be proficient in a particular skill without having been taught how to be proficient is familiar to me as an instructional designer. When I interview SMEs to build a course, there is often a tiered approach to the learning outcomes that can lend itself to an adaptive learning approach. To apply it to your example, if a student is obviously struggling with questions related to map skills, the training should ""fall back"" and ensure that the student has the requisite skills with which to answer questions involving map skills. It can often be difficult to unearth those ancillary (yet necessary) skills because SMEs just expect the students to come prepared with those skills. Regar[lastname]g your third challenge, it sounds like a good opportunity for gamification. I say this because silos of knowledge, like you describe, can be very effectively related when they are contextualized within a game setting. It sounds like depth of knowledge is more important than breadth of knowledge for this exam, but the learning theories of scaffol[lastname]g and constructivism would dictate that the learning is more likely to stick when it is shown within the context of the bigger picture. For instance, if a student only studies Spain's history, they won't understand how England's history affected some of Spain's biggest decisions. The challenge is how to ""un-silo"" some of the learning in order to add context and create a richer learning experience. I've been involved in BOK (Body of Knowledge) projects and it's always a challenge to create the matrix by which you can begin the ""chunking"" process. I admire you for taking on such a complex topic. Good luck and hopefully I'll be able to see what you accomplished down the road!"	9/1/2015 16:12	2080		
Student41	Student39	1	"When I discuss projects like this with K-12 teachers, I find there's a lot of ""technology fatigue."" Administrators often purchase systems (hardware and software) without teachers' input and the systems fail because of lack of adoption. If you like a good laugh, take a look at this South Park clip related to the phenomena: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXbje3Czh4k Treating teachers as stakeholders in a project may be one of the very important steps. There is such a diverse set of requirements from teachers of different subjects, but my conversations often would indicate that the systems being foisted on them weren't intuitive and didn't meet their needs. In other words, the effort they needed to expend on using the system wasn't worth the returns that the system provided. Inclu[lastname]g them in the design phase of such an ini[firstname]tive may help overcome that negative factor."	9/2/2015 13:11	1110		
Student41	Student83	2	"These are both great topics of exploration. Regar[lastname]g the scalability of the OMSCS program, I recall rea[lastname]g about scaling up to 10,000 students within three years (https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/14/georgia-tech-and-udacity-roll-out-massive-new-low-cost-degree-program). Has ""accepting any qualified student"" overtaken that previous number? Even at 10,000, I think I read that the program is at ~2,800 students after two years, so we probably won't see 10,000 for some time. The ""tool workflows"" that you cited as a bottleneck. Is there enough commonality between the courses that this cold be addressed at a systemic level? I know in a class like SDP that the TAs are having to inspect and run Java code. I never really got any feedback regar[lastname]g the cleanliness or efficiency of my code and I always got the impression that they were running the code more than they were inspecting it. My point in mentioning the SDP class is that I felt the TAs were doing more to grade the assignments than the TAs in the CN class had done. While no good class will ever be fully reliant on an automated system (gra[lastname]g multiple choice questions), what is that level of involvement that makes GaTech a top ten program and what where is the line under which it cannot cross? Regar[lastname]g your topic of diagnosis, I found this article to be very interesting (http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2015/06/us_millennials_know_technology.html) and there may be something larger at play. I've heard from parents that their children seem to be more reliant on instructions than my generation (Gen X) previous was. For instance, children going outside to play don't seem to possess the same self-organizational (and, in a sense, problem-solving) skills as previous generations. They need to be told what to do. This bodes poorly for diagnosis skills. This seems antithetical to me. We're living in an age where we can create realistic simulations much more easily. That is, we can create problematic scena[lastname] for students to solve much more easily. Articles like this (http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/07/02/millennials-struggle-to-pass-life-skills-101/), however, make the case that technological advancements have made younger minds less creative. When I think about my own experiences with computers (and I've been playing with them since the early 80s), you really had to have diagnosis and problem-solving skills to make them work. With the Baby Boomers, it was probably working on cars. Now it's nearly impossible to be a DIY mechanic because of the complexity of moden automobiles. I'm sure robotics are a modern field in which diagnosis and problem-solving are still very important. Your question about whether a single tool can improve a learner's ability to diagnose distinctly different fields... I think that tool is the Internet. We have the ability to diagnose problems more quickly than any generation in history. The relationship of learner and mentor is something that I think I'll be investigating with my project. Regardless of which path you choose, I think you've got a winning topic. I hope that we're able to review other students' final results. Good luck."	9/5/2015 20:15	10	7	"This is a very thoughtful, helpful feedback - I can tell [firstname] read my paper thoroughly and considered the material.

Student41	Student51	1	"This is a fascinating topic, [firstname]. I must confess that my knowledge of autism isn't very strong, but after seeing the latest statistics (and with a five-month-old asleep in the room next door), my interest is piqued. I think your doubt about using iMovie is probably common among many parents. I wonder if there isn't an opportunity here to develop an app specifically designed to help parents create their own VSMs. I just checked the Apple App Store and I didn't see any existing apps designed to do that. I hope that you're able to connect with Dr. Buggey as a partnership with a software developer might be a dream come true for him. Good luck with your project.

Student101	Student98	1	"Great idea for your project! I agree and can see how such a project could help understand students and see poten[firstname]l issues before they become problems. Two things that stand out to me. One, I agree how the privacy issue on such data collection would have to be priority number one. Two, allowing the student access to such material would be a must, not just for performance reasons but for verification too. I say this coming from experience. For example, when I joined the Marines they required all of my doctor records since birth. Being that some of those records had incorrect information in them (they switched my step mother's name with my biological mother's name in some documents) and created issues that should not have been. You can see how that verification of such data/information collected would be important, perhaps not just from the student but from other family members too. Again, great idea!"	9/1/2015 17:45	1455	7	Josh provided great feedback and personal examples. Josh also pointed out great topics that need to be addressed in Assignment 2.

Student101	Student4	1	"""Problem areas are broad and a single solution to the problems might not be possible. But I feel even a rudimentary attempt in solving the problem with the help of technology can bring positive results."" I concur! It appears there are numerous problems you want to address. I do understand some of the issues you mentioned like lack of motivation and lack of understan[lastname]g. For example, I know someone who has a Bachelors in CS but cannot do simple computer maintenance, how can this be? Perhaps more hands on learning, or have required practical exams to prove that they do in fact know what they should, could be poten[firstname]l solutions. Not stating these are the solutions but that some solutions poten[firstname]lly are simple. You are not alone in wanting solutions to the problems you have suggested, and I am interested to see where you go with this."	9/1/2015 18:10	2530		
Student52	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], Great explanation of the general problem of accessing many systems for each class in the OMSCS program. I, as many other students, definitely agree with you. Firstly, thanks for tackling a project on this scale. This is no small feat to begin working on a one-stop solution that involves so many different systems. You certainly sound motivated to take the challenge, though, and that is an excellent way to start this project! I work in IT at a university and was recently approached by the Information Security department that the state is soon going to require a single-pane-of-glass view for systems alerting/management/monitoring internally, as well as for provi[lastname]g that information to auditors. That means pulling all of our monitoring solutions, data collection methods, and updating practices into one system to rule them all. Over the past few months, we've worked diligently towards that goal and almost ready for a 'final' solution. In the process, it's been incredible to see what is actually possible in making this request a reality and how it will pay off in the long run. I mention this example, although not exactly related, but similar in concept of unifying many processes into one for the sake of simplicity. Achieving the single-pane-of-glass view for OMSCS students would make the program experience more efficient and enjoyable because students could login to one page and all the information needed is right in front of them. I am pretty sure GT has SSO implementated because one of the links I use for accessing Udacity goes through this site- https://web.iam.gatech.edu/udacity-login. I think the portion 'web.iam' is what I've seen elsewhere perhaps handling other SSO authentications. I usually sign into BuzzPort first and then click the Udacity link because SSO will take care of the rest. I did a quick search for GT SSO and came up with a couple links that might be helpful, although I'm sure you would need to work with OIT at GT in order to setup SSO authentication with the systems we're using in OMSCS. https://mystuff.gatech.edu/ http://login.gatech.edu/ My experience in web development is minimal so I am not able to provide much feedback in that respect, but I hope the rest of this information may provide some benefit to you on this endeavor. Good luck and I definitely look forward to hearing about your experiences!"	9/1/2015 19:20	2060	7	Thanks for the detailed feedback!
Student52	Student17	1	"Hi [firstname], Great write-up on your thoughts about why there is a large gap in the advancement of teaching in the public K-12 system. What�s interesting is that I was rea[lastname]g the start of your paper and thinking to myself about all these other companies and industries that are making advancements with technology because they are driven by revenue. Then I read your statement �Because it�s not a business� and realized I was on the same page as your thinking! My wife has been a high school math teacher for a number of years. She has expressed frustrations as well with many of the teaching practices regar[lastname]g introducing technology as part of the educational experience. Especially with math where it would be very helpful to provide students with clear examples about how the math they're working on in the classroom in applicable in the real-word, such as with enhanced 3-D visuals to target students that are more visual-based learners. There are often many solutions to �throw� at the problem, but they�re typically inadequate products. Not to get too far off track, but the problem with scena[lastname] like this are often not a technical issue, but instead a political and budgetary issue. With that, I�d like to ask if you�ve considered looking at private school systems as part of your research to see if they are successful at integrating technology into the classroom, since they are typically revenue-based much like how the private sector operates. If a business isn�t performing well, then they will not last long in their industry. I think this research topic will be very interesting and I look forward to hearing about the results throughout this course. I hope some of this information is beneficial to you!"	9/1/2015 20:18	180		
Student52	Student79	1	"Hi [firstname], Guten Tag! Ich lerne Deutsch am Duolingo auch. Meine Mutter kommt aus Deutschland so ich habe viel Familie im Europa. Es tut mir leid. I probably made many mistakes typing those few sentences but it was nice to try at least. :-) I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your paper and thoughts on how to improve the learning process when studying a foreign language. I just discovered Duolingo a couple months ago after rea[lastname]g about Google investing about $45 million into the project, so I decided to give it a try. I�m using it to refresh my German skills since I took a couple semesters in my undergrad and also to help with speaking to relatives. I also picked up Spanish since a lot of my friends are Hispanic, so it�s been fun to understand them more and par[firstname]lly converse with them in Spanish. As you mentioned in your paper, being able to understand a foreign language provides you with a better opportunity to understand other people and their cultures. Plus, I think it�s unique to see how some words are closely related or derived from each other in foreign languages to lend perspective to culture and language in general. Japanese was the primary language I was looking forward to picking up with Duolingo, but unfortunately they do not yet offer Asia languages. I studied Japanese in high school and college, plus was a foreign ex[lastname]e study for a short period. That language seems to have stuck with me the most, which I feel is related to my instructors always requiring us to play out scena[lastname] with dialog for that particular setting. Going back to your point on learning a foreign language, while in Japan I was immersed in the language with the people and culture around me. Again, this sort of goes back to using dialog to learn a language. Having someone else to speak with and practice makes the learning process more enjoyable and easier to understand, in my experience. There other resources out there like Rosetta Stone, as you mentioned, but I recall those products being expensive. Hopefully you won�t have to invest too much for this project. Your idea about provi[lastname]g definitions in the rea[lastname]g reminded me of a Google Chrome app that provides a definition of a word when you double-click on it. I pictured the same concept with your description except the functionality would be to [lastname]slate the word or expression. I think you�re off to a great start and sounds like you have a good plan already for this research project. I hope some of the information I shared was helpful. Good luck!"	9/1/2015 20:21	2282	6	
Student52	Student25	1	"Hi [firstname], It sounds like you are already passionate about the field of remote access computing from your paper. I think you hit the nail on the head with the discussion about maintaining educational software and/or hardware given the cost of licenses or the complexities involved with creating such environments. Java is a perfect example, as you mentioned, where different applications require different versions of Java in order to properly function. These types of limitations can greatly take away from the overall goal of provi[lastname]g a sound educational experience to students. The example you provided regar[lastname]g AutoCAD seems very interesting considering the hardware and software typically required to run the application smoothly, much less over a remote access connection. I think there are certain technologies that could assist you in this area to help, such as VMware Horizon View to deliver a robust virtual desktop infrastructure, Fusion-io for extremely fast storage devices, high-end graphics cards, and products like Teradici hardware accelerators which �reduce CPU overhead by dynamically offloa[lastname]g the most active displays, to ensure its capabilities are used where most needed � increasing server consolidation ratios by up to 2xs.� I�ve listed some of the products below for you to review if you haven�t already seen them. http://www.vmware.com/products/horizon-view/ http://www.fusionio.com/ http://www.teradici.com/products-and-solutions/pcoip-products/hardware-accelerator In regards to testing AutoCAD in a remote access scenario, here are some samples I found that may help lead you to the best solution.

Student96	Student81	1	"I love it... Augmented reality has always seemed like a good tool. In some ways, it doesn't even need to have a remote person drawing on screens in front the of the ""on site"" person. Someone speaking in their ear, seeing their video, getting stats on the subject (person, car, etc) would be great. I've often thought about something similar when working on cars and using my phone to watch YouTube instructional videos. Dirt covered hands just don't work well with cell phones. I saw something similar at a mechanic shop though where they had a big computer with instructional videos and a suitably protected computer. Anyway, I love the project and look forward to hearing more."	9/2/2015 12:09	331	6

Truly, this has the poten[firstname]l to be a great platform on which to incorporate all sorts of learning, inclu[lastname]g the causes you mentioned in your assignment. My one question for the IT stuff would be how to ensure the content [lastname]slates well. I think that written documents can be done well if people put the effort in. That said, as an engineer, the last thing I want to do is work on documentation, video or otherwise. If I do a shoddy job passing my knowledge on to the next guy with a written document, I'm not sure I would do any better making a video about it either. The ability to screen-share might help although you always run the risk of going too quickly or too slowly through various lessons. Just my two cents, definitely a problem that can be handled but one worth considering."	9/2/2015 14:27	714	7	"I think one of the problems with my vacillating between two targets it gets difficult to narrow focus to one problem.

Student66	Student22	1	"Hey, I have to admit, having to deal with large blocks of text , I really appreciated the bulleted approach you took. Now, to the topic, I personally resonated with Ideas #1 and #4 the most. I do like Idea #1. I am actually planning on doing game-based learning to help teach elementary school students the fundamentals of programming. I think it is an important topic to teach the fundamentals of technology but I would have to agree that a slide deck is probably not what is being asked for in the course. An interactive way to learn that stuff, on the other hand, would definitely be applicable. If you were somehow able to make a game out of networking components or the innards of a computer (kinda playing off of Idea #3), you might have something. I saw that Piazza post where people were talking about something similar to Idea #4 and I think it's an awesome idea. It does seem like it would be a unbearable amount of work to do the whole thing, however. The most difficult part of Idea #4 would likely be defining the scope of this iteration of the project but you could probably discuss that with your mentor. Good luck!"	9/3/2015 6:51	776	7	This particular feedback to me seems helpful as it seems straightforward as if we were talked to each other in the hallway. For some reason the format seems good and he gave me the type of feedback I was looking for.
Student66	Student28	1	"I couldn't agree more about your general assessment of educational technology as a whole. It has been historically difficult to find a golden formula for education and that is hard for us tech-oriented people to accept. I really like your idea of subconscious learning. I recall, when I was taking Circuits in college, I had built a subconscious understan[lastname]g of the fundamental rules early on that made up the circuit diagrams. The formulas had become like second-nature to me which was absolutely invaluable. I think it's a great topic, the question is how to pursue study of it. I would suggest that you get entirely caught up to date with constructivism (or another area of study if you find one more relevant to your idea). I would then aim for a compare/contrast along with information on the problems that your idea is better-equipped to solve than constructivism is. That way, you can build upon the already existing discipline instead of having to build an entirely new field of study."	9/3/2015 7:04	885	7	"That's a great recommendation, which could help scope the research topic!"
Student66	Student72	1	I had actually never heard of the Montessori education before rea[lastname]g this but it sounds like a cool idea. I thought you did a great job characterizing the attitude of the various stakeholders of the Montessori education towards technology. I thought the last quote you had (from Montessori Madmen) was particularly striking. The question I have is how you plan to proceed. Do you intend to continue doing research on what Montessori teachers are currently using in terms of technology? Or do you want to create/propose a tool that they could use going forward? I think defining a concrete goal up-front will really help guide the project going forward. The nice thing is that it seems like a very open subject which means you could take it a lot of different ways. Good luck! I look forward to seeing your project.	9/3/2015 20:39	2326	5

Where are they looking etc to alleviate the need for people to be watching someone at all times. Perhaps they could look at someone and if the program isn't sure if someone is cheating sent an invite to a person to look in on it. Perhaps they could also make it so that when people finish they don't have to, in some cases, wait around for a proctor to OK their turning their test in like I've heard about in some cases.

You may be able to add a lot of nice graphs and charts also to show progress of each students. This could work with a class like what we're in right now that has many assignments and projects (For example fin[lastname]g a way to represent attendance vs engagement. or attendance vs grades).	9/2/2015 21:56	35	6	"Thank you for the feedback [firstname]! In my case, I've always been a team of one there at the college so I typically take something from concept to completion and can work with the frontend/backend parts ok...so I'm hoping I won't run into large snags during development :-)."
Student84	Student42	1	"I have a 3.5 year old also. My project is also focused on something targeting that age group as well. Considering your project focus I would say if you do this right it can provide a lot of benefit to all communities. I would suggest keeping your final design with two way interaction in mind. There's a ton of one way information being given to children of that age and not many true interactive educational tools are available. By true interactive I mean something similar to how Udacity works with the quizzes. If you answered wrong it helps you by telling you if you got something right or are you all wrong. Another thing that comes to my mind is to focus on a small number of examples for your media form, but build them to what you truely imagine."	9/2/2015 21:57	733		
Student84	Student52	1	"You have a good idea. While rea[lastname]g towards the end of your writing I started to visualize a tool where a student programmer would be writing some simple code - like a for loop and a bunch of if statements in there to pick pizza toppings depen[lastname]g on a dorm room's occupant's list of desired topping - and get instant feedback with complete explanation and help from the AI. Simple code, but a little more involved of a problem to help the student work out the logic of programming. I could see it poten[firstname]lly benefiting students without any prior programming knowledge. In my opinion your audience stops there, since anywhere past that I would think a training setup for programming could show to be of a slower pace than what the beginner and higher students would want to use."	9/2/2015 22:09	816	6	
Student84	Student79	1	Interesting idea. I'll try and follow what you find our through your research. My wife and I are bi-lingual and have struggled communicating with our 3.5 year old son in both languages. So far English is the official language :) . Your focus seems to be a very challenging one for such a short period of time so your last paragraph makes sense. I would suggest if you could also make your platform be open so that speakers of other languages can provide their knowledge through your tool's teaching methodology. Good luck. Interesting topic.	9/2/2015 22:23	653	6	
Student64	Student5	1	You seem to have a good understan[lastname]g of what you want to do and have a plan moving forward.	9/3/2015 1:05	669		
Student64	Student9	1	You have shown a good knowledge on the background of your area of interest and have specified areas where it can be improved. I look forward to seeing how your research and project pans out.	9/3/2015 15:24	1800		
Student64	Student32	1	Very well thought out idea. Is there a specific area you plan to focus on for the duration of this semester?	9/3/2015 15:59	849		
Student64	Student19	2	Very thorough and elaborate explanation of the area in which you want to focus.	9/3/2015 23:37	2871	4	
Student87	Student32	1	"The Intelligent Tutoring System is a really good idea. Maybe you can include an interactive part to verify if the student had an aha moment. For example, after they have an aha moment, have the tutor ask them if they understand the material. Then, give them one or two practice problems to verify this. If they are able to solve the practice problems, then I would include this as an aha moment and give the tutor a reward (this is a reference to [lastname]forcement learning). For the flight simulator, it seems like you have a lot of domain knowledge and have a good idea of what to offer. This seems like a very ambitious plan though. Is there a certain part you hope to implement in this class and then maybe branch out in the future from there?"	9/3/2015 9:38	13		
Student87	Student64	1	"It seems like you should start with researching unsupervised machine learning methods such as clustering. When you do, you should be able to group students based on information provided in the data set. I would then maybe branch out and look at recommendation engine research literature to see which ones are applicable to this. I think it's definitely doable in the time we have available. And would look great on a resume if you are looking to go into machine learning."	9/3/2015 9:38	424	7	"Student87, thanks for your feedback! Very helpful advice!"
Student87	Student9	2	"This is a very good idea proposal. You have an area that you want to research and have actually begun researching it and it's theoretical underpinnings (which puts you ahead of the rest of us). The only problem that I see is because you are going to be one of the first to relate educational mechanics with game mechanics, you may face some backlash in your technique used at relating the two subjects. People in academia love to have things completely solidified; and if it's not, they can become very critical. I think that you have a good direction though and really look forward to seeing the results."	9/3/2015 9:46	629	6	
Student87	Student5	2	"I think you did very well at outlining the problems that are present in MOOC's and did a good job at explaining what some possible solutions are. I think that the reason why engagement is so low is because people just aren't committed to them. They say their going to do it and get excited; but there really isn't any reason to commit to them. I think that if you wanted to narrow down your problem, a good topic would be to try to find out a way to increase course engagement. It would be difficult; but definitely worth it in the long run."	9/3/2015 9:56	812		
Student33	Student58	2	I think this is an excellent idea. Maybe I can propose a Idea of using the intelligent tutoring system to recommend rea[lastname]g or training once the student has bottomed out so that the student can spend some of there own time coming up to speed in order to fill in the knowledge gap. but overall your idea is great and well though out.	9/3/2015 13:08	3077	6	The reviewer provided a thoughtful comment on my paper.
Student33	Student29	1	I think this is an excellent idea. This will definitely be useful because this is basically virtual repair simulation. I get how this will be beneficial to the company in the long run by familiarizing your technicians with the different parts of the planes without having to have them on site.. What I see as a solution is the use of something like an Autocad to create the 3D version and then there being a 3D model that displays how the parts are inter[lastname]eable or replaceable which can also be done in AutoCAD or Mechanical Desktop.	9/3/2015 14:00	376	7	I love that the reviewer added on and extended my idea.
Student33	Student87	2	"Cool Topic. I never hear of the Oculus Rift technology before, but it sounds very interesting. I definitely agree with the importance of having more kids involved in STEM. I am not familiar with virtual reality but using it in the form of Augmented Reality sounds extremely engaging and I totally agree that Common Core is substandard. Great job."	9/3/2015 14:08	310		
Student33	Student64	2	Good Idea Rod. I can see how this is related to Student behavior and my question to you would be gathering this data. Would this be through surveys of some sort. But You are definitely on the right track here and I look forward to seeing more of your work.	9/3/2015 14:13	105	5	Thanks for your feedback. My approach to this will be very important.
Student73	Student77	2	Love the idea. I completely agree with and share your sentiments regar[lastname]g forums gen[firstname]ally and Piazza specifically. I like your idea about upvoting and think that idea could work - it may even work within something like Piazza. I'm looking forward to seeing this project take shape.	9/3/2015 15:43	3433		
Student73	Student35	1	I like this project idea a lot. I think it would help for you to narrow your project down to one or two of the problem areas and try to make a contribution in that. I think something along analyzing code contributions would be really cool (taking into account the problems you mentioned - ie many commits don't mean a large contribution).	9/3/2015 16:40	205		
Student73	Student96	1	"This sounds interesting and could help you from a business perspective and customers better utilize your program. I'm interested to see how specifically you tackle the problem, as there are a lot of SAAS and commercial product out there for things like FAQ, help sections, etc already. Community learning would be interesting, but would also be interesting to see if you could come up with good incentives to get your customers learning and engaged in the learning vs just ad[lastname]g a community support feature."	9/3/2015 16:44	267	6	
Student73	Student81	1	Very cool. I would have liked to see a little more information about the problem you are addressing. I'm guessing it's the difficulty of training and assisting new techs in a hostile environment? Sounds like a very interesting project.	9/3/2015 16:48	177	6	
Student47	Student60	1	"Interesting facts and figures. 9% doesn't seem promising, but I guess it also depends also on the number of students enrolled. The question you propose is a worthwhile one and I'd be interested to see what you come up with, especially because EdTech is such a participation heavy class. I'd be curious to see what the retention rate of EdTech is compared to other OMSCS courses. I'm also curious to see how many people opt to do the EdTech project in a group and how they met/formed the group (maybe a piazza survey?)."	9/4/2015 0:11	589	6	Got some insights from this feedback. It was helpful.
Student47	Student33	1	"Good topic, and it helps that you have kids of your own to use as testing samples! Are there specific programming languages that are better for teaching 6-11 year olds? Are specific devices (desktop web, mobile, ipad, console, etc) better for teaching kids to code? Check this out for some ideas as well: https://www.pluralsight.com/kids Also, It would also be interesting to know what the average age that people started to learn to code is in the class."	9/4/2015 0:21	1481		
Student47	Student58	1	"i thought #2 (responsive series of hints) is an interesting solution. On the one hand it seems like it would cut back on users abusing the hint system, on the other hand, if someone really is stuck then it would just be frustrating and cause me to give up quicker. I'd also like to see a system which can not only detect when a student is struggling on a problem, but also understand what specific concepts of the problem the student is stuck on and present more relevant material."	9/4/2015 0:46	895	6	Constructive review of my paper.
Student47	Student29	1	"I'm no aerospace engineer so I can't comment on the subject matter specifically, but I think your idea is really cool and has a lot of applications in many other fields like automobiles, healthcare, public safety training simulations, etc. You asked a lot of great questions so it sounds like you already have a really good idea of where your research should go towards next!"	9/4/2015 1:01	633	6	I like that they commented about other uses beyond the aircraft industry.
Student4	Student6	1	Enjoyed rea[lastname]g the problem statement. Best of luck!	9/4/2015 7:30	337	4	"I like that they enjoyed my problem statement, but where can I improve? What will make it exceed expectations?"
Student4	Student49	1	Great idea!	9/4/2015 7:35	1921		
Student4	Student18	1	"Great area of study! Teacher awareness is an additional reason which I feel can be one of the important reasons. If teachers are exposed to technological advancements in education and their benefits , they can make sure that message is passed on to the students at the grass root level"	9/4/2015 8:08	334	5	
Student4	Student3	1	"This write-up does represents the need of technology in education sector. However, I am not able to understand what role you envisage for yourself and as part of this course you can play in bringing the political or cultural [lastname]e required to make widespread adoption possible. Maybe in the coming weeks you would like to narrow down your scope"	9/4/2015 8:14	935	5	"Currently analyzing further investigation opportunities and poten[firstname]l solutions. Agreed, need to narrow down scope of work to come."
Student12	Student98	1	I think this is a very interesting topic. Environments have a big impact on people so It'll be interesting to see what you find as you progress.	9/4/2015 10:47	268	6	Reviewer confirmed that the chosen topic was suitable for class and as a final project. The reviewer also confirmed that Environments have a huge impact on the way people learn. More emphasis needs to be placed on environments other than school.
Student12	Student101	1	I also find that many people I interact with lack basic technical knowledge. Having videos is a great way to introduce technology to people.	9/4/2015 10:52	344		
Student12	Student59	1	"This seems like a neat idea. While I don't feel I know enough about this subject to give any real feedback, I'm interested to see the end result."	9/4/2015 10:48	761	2	Not enough detail to be helpful.
Student12	Student68	1	I like the idea of bringing CS courses into high school. Maybe incorporating online courses that are offered on sites like Lynda.com in the schools but ad[lastname]g a curriculum and a semester-pace around it.	9/4/2015 10:57	341		
Student100	Student40	1	"Definitely a thorough look at a number of options for an assignment. Good background information on all of them, inclu[lastname]g why each would be important to you and to specific challenges you face. For obvious reasons give your background, all of these are more on the administrative side of education technology. Honestly, the third I'd actually have a hard time even categorizing as EdTech. The second is EdTech in it's integration with Banner, but otherwise is likely to mostly be a CMS (integrating an existing CMS with Banner might be the better solution here). The first is a bit more EdTech in nature. But I worry a bit that you might be just creating a third option that will just end up being a third option instead of a best-of-breed preferred option. If I had to choose one, I'd probably lean towards the attendance system. But I would also suggest keeping your eyes open for other poten[firstname]l projects that might expand your experience with other areas of EdTech. Perhaps with another group."	9/4/2015 10:57	637	6	"So I'm realizing this might not actually make it's way back to [firstname] directly, but thank you for the feedback. I do have the concern that my ideas aren't exactly fitting within the EdTech definition most people seem to be having at the moment, but that area of buil[lastname]g technology is really my prime area of interest...a lot of the other areas I'm seeing others focus on/mentioning either I'm not that knowledgeable about (so I can't really come up with a project idea in that area) or I might simply not be that interested in, which might sound bad, but it would definitely make this semester/project a lot more fun if it was relevant to my work and could be useful for the college I work with."
Student100	Student84	0	"I'm really not clear what is being proposed here. I can definitely see the problem domain and can stretch to perhaps include this as educational technology (seems like this includes a collaborative data sharing system of some sort designed to educate parents?). But beyond that, I can't really nail down what you intend here. There is a mix of things you hope to research and perhaps share on a web site along with some needs to gather data about stuff. We're still in the brainstorming phase, so this is probably okay. And I do understand your problem domain (still going through it myself). But I'd definitely suggest thinking hard about how you might narrow the scope of this effort down into a workable solution."	9/4/2015 11:08	554	6	Legitimate criticism. The more research I do the more I see the need to narrow down.
Student100	Student50	2	"Well thought-out and conceived document. You are definitely on the right track here with your prep. Hopefully you can find some archival data to use for this. Survey research is likely not going to be doable in the time allotted. If you can't find meaningful archival data to help answer whatever ultimate research question you decide on, you might also consider just writing a really solid and complete literature review on the topic. Or maybe even a basic meta-analysis (though this might be difficult). Regardless, it is an interesting and important topic. I look forward to seeing how you address it and what you are able to achieve."	9/4/2015 11:18	936		
Student100	Student90	1	"This was an interesting paper. You present a wide array of cognitive issues and solutions intertwined with personal experiences. A little chaotic (almost stream of consciousness at times), but interesting and probably appropriate for this stage. I was very appreciative of the summary, though. I wasn't clear what your eventual goals were until I got to the summary. I think the idea is good. Especially since you have a muse to inspire you. Hopefully you can come up with a unique solution to her challenges (and other similar ones) based on your research."	9/4/2015 11:34	670	7	
Student90	Student42	1	"I think that the ""Project Focus,"" even though is the conclusion of the previous text, should have been included at the top of the paper to give the reader a clue on what the paper was all about. I do not disagree completely with the organization. It is organized in a way that people from Europe or South Am[firstname]a tend to organize literary work. You always need to read the end to actually make sense of the beginning. Still it is a good paper and explains the problem and the proposed project well."	9/4/2015 12:15	665		
Student90	Student40	1	"I think it was a great idea to give briefly cover last assignment, as we were not given the benefit of rea[lastname]g it. The fact that you mention it, gives us some continuity. I think that all three projects are a good idea and viable. You do a good job with the explanation."	9/4/2015 12:27	491	6	"Thanks [firstname]! (If this is comment is being sent straight to [firstname], I guess you can see how in some cases people are fine with the ideas but in other cases they are not, and I'm just not sure exactly where the definition of EdTech is supposed to start and end, because different people seem to have different ideas of what it means)."
Student90	Student84	1	"This was an enjoyable paper that, like many of the papers being written on this class, has started with a personal story and eventually converged into specific goals. As I've been in the role of a father for many years, I wonder if your search could be directed to collecting this data by searching on existing social media forums such as Facebook. My kids were born before the facebook age. However, I see very often other family members with babies or small children posting so much statistical information about their children that it seems a waste not to collect it and analyze it to understand patterns."	9/4/2015 12:35	569	6	"Interesting suggestion. I have my concerns about collecting data in that way, but I appreciate the suggestion because it does make me think about other possibilities similar to the one proposed."
Student90	Student50	1	I'm a little lost rea[lastname]g this paper. I'm not completely sure what the intent of the project is. Does the project entail rea[lastname]g about retention research and then write a paper based on that research?	9/4/2015 12:45	460		
Student30	Student50	2	"Hi [firstname], My feedback is that this write-up is a good start and a worthwhile topic. It seems to me you are on track and I like your division of relevant academic literature into Cognition/Individual Differences, Retention Modelling, Retention Engineering (my favorite) and Outcomes. I took a quick look at these and agree that at least for this small sample, the literature does appear dated and what was especially glaring to me was the apparent lack of viable predictive models. I'd be interested to see if you can uncover more on this. One factor touched on in your write up and not explicitly discussed (that I saw, anyway) in the literature you cite is my experience. Demographically, I am older, well educated, interested, inclined to self-study and disciplined - given this background I have signed up for many free or inexpensive online courses through most of the major providers - Kahn, Udacity, Coursera, EdEx, Udemy, Codecademy, Harvard and Sanford extension courses, etc. While I have completed dozens of these courses, I have sampled/started dozens more that I have not completed. For me this is in part a sampling exercise, where I am 'kicking the tires' and starting the course - not always with a full intention to finish, and in other cases with a tentative intention to press on, but frequently a course will not 'make the cut' in terms of priorities - this is particularly true, in both my and I imagine is true for many others - because as is pointed out in the literature, there are no barriers to entry - no or little cost, and quick, easy signup. It reminds me of my habit of picking up a book, and frequently it does not hold my interest so I put down in favor of other activities. It also reminds me of 'cart abandonment' behavior in ecommerce websites - which I have built for years - where 'browsers' frequently do not complete the [lastname]saction and turn into 'buyers.' In some cases this is poor design - where the shopper has to enter checkout to preview shipping rates, and in other cases it is because checkout is a ponderous UX - and in other cases the poten[firstname]l buyer simply will not take that final step to 'commit' to the purchase. In my experience having taught high school and college students for many years, both face-to-face and online, many of the retention techniques recognized in the literature - such as praise/feedback, badges and the like are helpful, and for my money one of the biggest factors is simply the quality of the material, presentation and the personalities of the teachers, as well the important factor mentioned in one of your references of a sense of 'belonging' to a class fostered by interaction with a live person. So, my point is that it is important to step back and ask what is it that we are measuring, and are these valid indicators or predictors? But this you know, I'm sure. FYI, I too am looking at a research track - with a focus on creating a survey and possible assessment of the state of Ed Tech today - who the players/vendor are, what are the apps, what is the state of adoption, trends and opportunities. Since this is a rapidly moving situation, and any work I do would represent at best a snapshot, I am thinking in terms of making this a Wiki and am still working through the exact shape this will take. It strikes me that your research complements mine in that buil[lastname]g if you will a better mousetrap and then ensuring good adoption are important keys to ultimate retention and successful outcomes. Any help I can be for you please let me know, and to confirm I think this is good research and a great start, Student30"	9/4/2015 11:43	3455		
Student30	Student90	2	"Hi [firstname], Very nice write up. There is tremendous power in the personal story, and I cannot imagine anything better than a personal experience of a parent motivated to create a better way to help his child. Your goal of investigating and poten[firstname]lly designing an app to improve math skills while improving self-esteem is a fine one - and I look forward to seeing how you incorporate best practices into your approach. I would add that my reaction to your story of the star Amanda received and her wonderful positive reaction is two points: (1) one of the reasons she had such a strong positive reaction, and improvement in self-esteem, etc. is precisely because of the personal connection she felt for her teacher, I think. In other words, one element that 'gamification' of online learning overlooks, I think, is that a badge can have little intrinsic psychic value/utility to the student if it does not have other dimensions - you mention as a mnemonic - but also something that has deep meaning - and that it is precisely this personal connection with her teacher - the recognition that another person (presumably whom she admires and wanted to gain attention and praise) - is the key element - especially in encouraging self esteem - it is the personal connection, I think, that creates the meaning and power of the star, and its efficacy. (2) You mentioned that the putting the star on the kitchen refrigerator afforded her the opportunity to re-tell her story to others - notice that this too is social - that the star was prominently displayed in one important center of family life in a way that gave her the opportunity to share the story - and that this activity of sharing was a key factor in promoting self esteem. So, it makes me wonder if incorporating these two factors - the human connection and a public display affor[lastname]g an opportunity for recognition and poten[firstname]l interaction with others - that could be key ingredients in a successful paradigm. Just my $0.02, Student30"	9/4/2015 12:41	1380	7	"Ned, Thank yo very much for your input. What you are saying is so connected with my fin[lastname]gs regar[lastname]g intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. My conclusion is that symbolism greatly affects motivation.

Student30	Student43	1	"Hi [firstname], I like this research topic and think that you are on track and that it is a worthwhile research area.

Student3	Student18	1	"Interesting that the problem has been narrowed down to Asian students instead of non-U.S. / minorities as a whole. How did you determine this? Regar[lastname]g your problems, the socioeconomic factors are pretty cut-and-dry in terms of research. Identifying a problem that you can investigate further and ideally offer a solution is the important factor. So, for the other two Problems you presented, I would be interested in what technology factors and cultural differences actually inhibit online learning. How do Asian students use technology differently than non-Asian students? Additionally, regar[lastname]g muli-cutltural content, how can content be presented differently to better support Asian students? Aside from simply offering the course in a different language than English, this appears to require extensive research into, for example, how Asian professors teach in an Asian university."	9/4/2015 13:02	1003	6

Student3	Student70	1	"Interesting concept. With the rise of the internet, everyone [I mean everyone] has an opinion. As you mentioned, how can those be validated? In my papers, I have already cited references to Blogs that cover my particular field of research. I have no idea how much experience the author has on that subject; whether I agree with him or not. Is the ""Blog Validator Crawler"" to be designed for research purposes? Possibly for OMSCS students in the Ed Tech course to utilize as they research a problem? If so, count me in as a test group! Not all Blogs are valuable, let alone valid. No matter the topic of discussion on a particular blog, you are sure to find an opinion that agrees, disagrees, and everything else in between on that subject matter. How can you incorporate opinions into the rating system? Or, when rating comments, are you simply rating Blogs based on how many ""Hits"" it has; regardless of validity. There are many grey areas in this Crawler concept to be considered if it will be valuable tool for, say, OMSCS students. Good luck!"	9/4/2015 13:27	678	7

Regar[lastname]g your emphasis on the apparent disconnect between Lecture and Student inquiry, I completely agree. There is an inevitable ""waiting-period"" between the Question being asked and the Answer being received. What if there is a followup inquiry related to the first inquiry? Get back into the waiting line. This can analogous to atten[lastname]g a university's office hours but at least you can incorporate that into your schedule in some way. Already, in this Ed tech course, I had to wait 4 days until my mentor responded with and Answer my Question. A few questions weren't even addressed at all! I take no offense to this but I would be interested in how you streamline this immediate-feedback idea in an online environment. I have no feedback on the Medical ideas. If that is your expertise, go for it!"	9/4/2015 13:39	719		
Student65	Student97	1	The one thing I was not sure about in your write-up is whether this would be intended to take the place of formal university training or if it was more intended to supplement a full degree in a technical discipline. It might be beneficial to narrow the scope a little bit for the class project because information security is a full area of specialization in a master's degree program.	9/4/2015 16:03	1387		
Student65	Student53	1	"This is a different sort of topic, interesting. It seems that education is the key to earlier adoption, and that a new tool needs to demonstrate a usefulness that currently used tools do not have."	9/4/2015 16:26	3101		
Student65	Student63	1	"I wasn't sure what your preliminary proposed project for this class might be after rea[lastname]g your assignment. You did a very good summary of ITS and ANDES, but only in the last sentence you mentioned integrating a course with that software. I'm not very sure what your goal is. I didn't want to say it didn't meet expectations, but I think you could expand on your ideas for a project a bit more."	9/4/2015 17:18	382		
Student65	Student78	1	"I am doing a project on ITS as well, and it appears you are looking at it from a slightly different but complimentary perspective. I am looking to create a tool to act as an ITS and allow teachers to administer AP exam practice questions to students in an organized fashion (following course content at any given time, and release questions accor[lastname]gly semi-automatically with minimal teacher set-up). It seems you are looking at ITS in the greater picture. From what you wrote, I gather that you are looking at both the teaching aspect of an ITS as well as the assessment aspect. I see the teaching aspect as being similar to what we are used to seeing in Udacity, in the form of the actual lectures and associated quizzes. The other side is the assessment, which is more what my proposed project is about. So if I'm understan[lastname]g you correctly, it looks like you are going to be comparing the teaching strategies with the assessment strategies and using that information to determine information about how a student is learning. This is an interesting topic. I would like to see how you develop your class project further, for example, what types of teaching strategies will you look at if that is part of the research? What different types of assessments and feedback would you try to incorporate or research?"	9/4/2015 17:24	654		
Student21	Student66	1	"Teaching programming based on games sounds like a nice research topic.

Looks like you have a clear vision of the project you will be working on. You have picked a topic that I recently had experienced last semester with Software Development Process. Looking at the interaction between team members is important and how do you do that with a limited number of TAs. Can a software solution solve this?

The problems in education due seem to be a lack in fun[lastname]g but not just in technology, but it�s the people that are required to support the technology. From working at a University, I�ve seen technology ini[firstname]tives fail due to the lack of support.

Student25	Student73	1	"Hey [firstname], Certainly agree with you on the scaling issue! The process to get classes seems like it could certainly be improved more and some type of advisement to make sure you are on track. After taking a couple of courses already you hit the nail on the head for all of the different systems you have to keep up with, now with this class we have �Peer Feedback�, and Proctoring Systems for mid-terms and finals. It seems like GATech has a nice portal that integrates a bunch of different systems like OSCAR, news feeds, and useful links. I think all of these tools could be brought together in a unified interface somehow with a unified top navigation bar. Just some thoughts, and good luck!"	9/4/2015 19:13	384

Student20	Student21	1	"It sounds like we have very similar course histories and experiences with the OMS CS program. I think a tool such as you described would be very beneficial for many students. Many times it is the lack of familiarity with the necessary tools that can hinder one's progress in a class, rather than the theories involved. I know that relearning C for AOS ahead of time would have helped tremendously with that class. I look forward to seeing what comes of your project!"	9/4/2015 19:20	173		
Student20	Student7	2	"I enjoyed your take on problem-based learning. I have often found myself just copying the code and process from a tutorial to solve a problem rather than figuring everything out by myself. This often leads to some head scratching if the tutorial uses invalid or missing resources or if the current SDK uses different libraries and functions than the tutorial. While it is possible to still learn from tutorials, your approach seems much more direct."	9/4/2015 19:23	220		
Student20	mdarden6@gatech.edu	1	"Your ideas of differen[firstname]ted learning are very intriguing.

Student91	Student41	1	"Hello [firstname], in this paper you give several points and illustrate well your position, what you know and what you don't know, with respect to M-Learning. I hope you get the right information to decide about your research/project. I can say that from your paper I got two concepts that I researched about and that will be helpful for preparing my Assignment 2, that will focus more on my actual project. Those concepts are LCMS and scaffol[lastname]g techniques which focus on knowledge Concepts management and how to understand them more deeply. These concepts are useful for me because my project will be about being able to review and remember easily a learned course and as a consequence understand it more deeply, and that could poten[firstname]lly make use of concept management and scaffol[lastname]g techniques."	9/4/2015 23:31	271		
Student91	Student18	1	"Hello [firstname], I think undeserved communities are very important if you want to democratize education as the MOOC trend is supposed to do. Not understan[lastname]g English is actually a big issue, and there comes other factors as you said as the socio-economic ones. But I believe there is still a factor of communication which is very important, and may be also one reason why poor people doesn't make enough use of MOOCs. Of course communication still affects all sectors, but probably much more the poor ones. As an example, I am Peruvian and when I mention other people in my country about MOOCS, most of them still don't know what MOOCs are, and the ones that know if they use them they make very little use. So I think communication and also promotion of MOOCs is not reaching every body in the same way and is an important factor here."	9/5/2015 15:41	17	7

Student13	epennington3@gatech.edu	1	"Thanks so much for your feedback [firstname]. Loved rea[lastname]g everything that you have been looking at. In terms of your work, I too agree that Betty's Brain was interesting. You mentioned that it looked interesting and related to your current goals. Would love to know how & in which way. Of course you mentioned the ""how"" in terms of how it has been used. That said, would love to see what is flying through your head during the next round methodology wise. Am super excited also about your mention of SimStudent. Funny how that works that you don't always keep up on what a previous lab is doing. I am in the same boat and have been there. Always so much to keep up on! That said, I did agree that the meta-cognition piece and rewatching the AI videos could help. I absolutely adored that class myself and found it very inspiring! In terms of your status update, I like that you stumbled upon the intelligent tutor piece. Now, I am curious to see how you evolve this in project 2? How many resources have youhad a chance to look at regar[lastname]g intelligent tutoring or intelligent agents? Have you wondered what makes an agent in this space intelligent. I was considering that very question myself in terms of buil[lastname]g an agent that could help me study. Can pure didaction work here and that be sufficient for some fields? A thought ... how do you code an argument into an agent? Could you make an agent be able to interpret a point of view and respond? I dont' know, but want to explore that myself in my own future research & PhD! Have a great night and keep up the good work. Excited on what you produce for assignment 2! - Nate"	9/5/2015 0:33	389		
Student13	Student8	1	"Hi Chris! I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your work! Overall, it sounds like you are moving along nicely! I love the concept of working to build a tool to help students with Autism. Now, I don't know anything on your background or whether you have worked with individuals with Autism. My mom was a special education teacher and I spent years working with autistic students (is why I raise this). I love the thought about using a video game. I also like your questoin about a video game as a great source. That said, I am curious overall and wonder how far you have stepped back. Have you done a literature review to consider the behavioral cues that can most impact (either positively or negatively), a person with autism. Also, there are things that might be relevent. Like, does age matter? Does autism [lastname]e over the course of ones life in such a way that you might need to target a stimulus to help them engage? What research has been done just on the act of increasing engagement in students with autism - forgetting the gaming side or anything else. This might help you make a profile of all the poten[firstname]l positive cues or levers that you have at your disposal to help inccrease the attention and learning. Also, I would be curious to see how much you have focused on the link between attention and learning itself. In [firstname]eting we often talk about different types of attention, and then the link between attention and behavior. There are different affect models that impact or that a person responds to depen[lastname]g on a situation and which impact how much decision making they do based on the attention stimuli. This could be interesting to consider, as a game would arguable poten[firstname]lly have heightened stimuli. Once you go down this path, the next question for me would be do to a mapping. Map all the stimuli that a game could provide (or all the interactions ... visual, sound, touch, peer experience through P2P, character development), and then start to map those back to an autistic learner. In fact, when I did similar things in educational gaming for the elderly and others we would also always map the same thing back to a baseline non-autistic learning. What are the differences? Which levers are different? One outcome of this might be proposing an experimental design that you can actually work on after the course with ethics approval & psychology to test and compare a baseline with an actual. What would that look like? Again, just throwing ideas your way? Keep up the awesome work, and reach out any time! - Nate"	9/5/2015 0:40	1790	1	This is amazingly helpful and I would like for this to be something people see. This is amazing.
Student13	Student67	1	"I loved your discussion on motivation [firstname]. It is something I was coincidentally discussing today with a number of folks! I also like your link between curiousity and motivation. It can take great motivation in research to remain curious. This is something that I myself have found and know that will be required if I pursue a PhD in the very near future. I myself keep a pretty busy schedule I suppose and people often ask what the motivation is. I don't know but it various. Sometimes is it family, work, aspirational, feedback poten[firstname]l, etc. I agree with you on the challenges of people dropping out from school. This is actually a key question in the education field, and you will see a lot of research if you haven't looked in the area of retention within strategic enrollment management. Check that out, or let me know if you need any help (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca ... It's Nate here). I like your thought starting with self determination theory. That is an interesting starting place. I agree with the theory that you need all the three that you talked about - competence, connection, and automony. My question would be what are the factors that determine this? Are, are there attributes that you could measure or include in an educational tool or experience that help improve someones feeling of competence, connection, or autonomy. Lots to think about here. I like your thought on the conditions, but would encourage you to read further on the conditions on motivation. There is a lot of research in the area of [firstname]eting which I teach which covers motivation and behavior, as well as within advertising. Be sure to check out those resources. Honestly, I would love to see your next assignment where you start to tackle the challenge of what conditions are needed for people to motivate themselves because honestly, I think there are a lot of unopened questions. Why does someone stay up and study extra things that can't immediately help them? How do you find the passion or energy? Are there actual deficits that cause this type of behavior? A counter thought. And, when you think of the advertising question on the Google Ads - have a look at the research already done there. How do people respond to advertisements about content from fields that is informative? Would the educational ads be informative or argumentative? Provocative? This is an essen[firstname]l advertising question though it does matter here? Also, as you start looking around, start to take an inventory of apps that are out there that provide interest tidbits of information to users. What do these apps have in common? Do they motivate competence? Sustain interest? Lots of questions here. Again, loved your ini[firstname]l thought & am eager to see how things unfold! Keep in touch! - Nate"	9/5/2015 1:17	756	7	
Student13	Student26	1	"Thanks for your assignment [firstname]! I greatly enjoyed rea[lastname]g your work. I think that your case study is interesting and I have been there before. I actually taught advanced JavaScript & AJAX and had the very same issue. In terms ofthe work that you are doing, I think your two chains are very useful. From a programmatic side, you might enjoy the work that [firstname] Orso does research wise relating to artificially intelligent testing tools. The use case is different. That said, you are looking for a testing tool to go through and spot issues or identify things, and then have logic embedded so that what is identified can be scored. Also, from the artifact perspective, I do think you are bang on there as well - the question of how to evaluate is key. I note that you called our defining project specific assestment and havign specific criteria. What I might ask you, is to step back and determine what criteria should be evaluated and, can a machine do it? Can a machine evaluate layout of items on a page? Interface? Design choices? Functionality? Can a machine do quick testing as if the application were live and simulate many users using the interface? What would all the dimensions be if you had to build a machine that could do those things? You nailed in on the evaluation criteria instructors use to evaluate submissions. That said, I would encourage you to step back. Go back to the requirements process. When buil[lastname]g a piece of software, what are all the requirements that you need to satisfy. I would expect that some of those would be selected for evaluation, but, that there would be great bias or different in how individual instructors interpret the results and submission. Again, just a thought here but I would not want you to get a skewed view of evaluation criteria (this coming from someone who teaches also in the grad and undegrad programs at a university). Then, you can focus on the technical analysis. Again though, I think you need to look at tools to measure requirements or features - and you can't do that until you really know the features. This, dig deeply here and you will have success. If you want to bounce ideas off of things don't hesitate to reach out (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca). Love the work and am excited to see what you produce! -Nate"	9/5/2015 1:32	856	7	"This is easily the best peer feedback comment I have received so far. I looked into Dr. Orso's publications and I wish he had more of them readily available on his website (!). Besides that I think Nate proposed many very good points here. As I build the interface I'm definitely wanting to make sure it can be used by many. Some of the things he mentions and we are actually trying to implement, include having some automatic checks we will run no-matter-what; this is sort of in the ""machine doing quick testing"" category. That being said we also want the instructor be able to set up test for their specific case."
Student70	Student41	2	"Hi [firstname], Very interesting topic! It is in fact a problem we discuss always as software developers. Honestly I still believe there is a long way to go when talking about programming languages and developing tools, even for web for example there is a long way to go. That is why more and more frameworks are coming up. And talking about mobile programming we have basically two big worlds, Android which is java, a well known programming language. And iOS, which just recently moved from ObjectiveC to swift. What I am very curious about is the solution that you are actually proposing because it can take different paths, there might be a new common programming language, a new very high level development tool such as Authorware that can [lastname]slate to different languages, might be a new programming paradigm or just new well designed tutorials that can help developers create powerful apps easy.

I still get very overwhelm every time I open piazza after two or three days of not using it. I really like your suggestion because, I do agree, taking notes might be very time consuming task. The only problem I can see is that students have very different ways to take notes, some of them prefer diagrams, other prefer tables, some other want to write almost every word the professor is saying and even one more group like to almost avoid notes. What I am afraid is that likely students will want to take their own notes even if there are some notes provided, because very likely they will use their own notes to study. I look forward to have these notes as an auxiliary resource! Good luck!"	9/5/2015 11:16	818	5

In fact I frequently talk about this problem with some co-workers because there are so many programming languages and frameworks that is really hard to keep up. It seems that now every company is creating its own language which is very specific for the current needs. Your idea of tutorials for easy learning based on your current skills is very interesting. It would be great to come up with an API which you can call to get the list of skills a person has. You just have to keep in mind that some developers still learn from books or courses which are not traced by any online resource, so you might want to include an option to manually select your programming level if there are not entries for online courses. I would be absolutely in to try your approach. Good luck!"	9/5/2015 11:29	1214	5	Good ideas! I like inclu[lastname]g manual selection of levels!

Actually I just finished another feedback which is trying to solve the opposite scenario, how to create programming learning tutorials for people with advanced skills. It seems that tutorials are very gen[firstname] and not ready for first time students or advanced programmers. I really like your approach, if you can create some intelligent tutorial that can teach you based on the way a specific student learns would be awesome.

Rather than working on solutions built specifically for your school system, what if you expanded the focus of your work and built these solutions (or just one one of them) to be more scaleable or applicable to educators at large?

(I am thinking that tools like Khan Academy and Duolingo do similar things to what you are describing in terms of rewards, but maybe not in such a way that achievements can be ""posted on the fridge"" and shared with those around them. I remember certain games from when I was little--Juliard Music Adventures--that taught music and lots that taught math, but I don't remember any that used music to teach math). Thanks again!"	9/5/2015 15:21	691	7	"Thanks for your comments. In assignment 2 I continue exploring several concepts that will feed an Intelligent tutoring system. Regar[lastname]g music and math, I'm focusing on an elicitation technique used by music therapists. My oldest daughter is a music therapy major and she has been composing songs for me. I'm hoping to include a recor[lastname]g on the third assignment."
Student36	Student67	1	"Great topic and references. Good understan[lastname]g of the problem statements and goals. At times, the sentence structure would run on or have a series of short phrases set by commas. If you organize your flow, your ideas will come off a bit more clear."	9/5/2015 17:47	116	5	
Student36	Student13	1	"Great topic, and you followed the rubric to a point. Keep developing your idea using the referenced work so you can focus your points in upcoming writeups."	9/5/2015 17:51	167		
Student36	Student38	1	"Good idea! Keep refining it so you don't take on too much scope in the end. Rather, focus on doing a smaller subset well."	9/5/2015 17:54	12	4	I feel like I just read a fortune cookie.
Student36	Student26	1	"Good work! For number #1, look at what points are important to the gra[lastname]g % and for #2 take a look at https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?hl=en"	9/5/2015 17:54	106	6	good link
Student15	Student80	1	"The concept of introducing game theory to address education is appealing, but the aforementioned paper does not discuss in enough detail how this will identify an Education Technology issue. The overall motivation behind the program is to develop concepts to address issues in Educational Technology, not education in general."	9/5/2015 18:00	758	2	"I'm going to say this is unhelpful since it is misguided. If I am wrong, please let me know. Separately, from the perspective of my project, it is interesting to know that ""cooperative but wrong"" and ""freeloader"" both appear as unhelpful in peer meta-feedback."
Student15	Student99	1	"There are several online technologies that address connecting content, teachers & learners. Most tech ed start-ups are sprung from folks who came from the education domain. A more detailed explanation on what is missing and what will this tool bring out would have helped."	9/5/2015 18:13	181		
Student15	Student30	1	Good luck in your exploration!	9/5/2015 18:16	154	3	Nice to have an affirmation... ;)
Student15	Student43	1	"I personally am not a fan of ""google hang-outs and other technologies for group work. These technologies do not allow me to focus, other than being used as a technology for collaboration. Good luck in your fin[lastname]g."	9/5/2015 18:19	84	4	
Student56	Student38	2	"I think this is a great topic. I'm sure that you'll have enough other students as well to form a group. I was in that KBAI class, as well, and the plagarism bit upset me. It's frustrating to spend hours and hours refining your code, and then imagine that other students got away with a simple ctrl+c, ctrl+v. Ultimately, though, they are compromising their own skills and will be at a disadvantage in the industry. Back to your paper, anyway - great idea, but I think it sounds very ambitious! However, I don't know your software development ability. I'm sure that if you could actually design this, it would be happily received and implemented. I'd suggest (well, you yourself actually suggested) narrowing the project scope. I'm curious why using the software that they currently have is, as you said, time consuming and complex. It seems like there should be a simple enough procedure -- i.e. can't the script that they use to download our assignments off of tsquare and run against their test cases, also run the submission against this plagarism detection software? Can't this be a matter of creating a script, rather than a new software application? Just my thoughts, but I actually know very little about the programs you described... Good luck with your project!"	9/6/2015 1:23	403	7	Good ideas on what the workflow should be for the instructor.
Student56	Student34	1	"Hello [firstname], I've seen you a lot on the piazza boards; nice to see some of your work! I haven't taken this class yet, so I'll definitely take your paper as warning. I like the idea of focusing on one specific class and refining it. It's a great project scope: a narrow enough context, with wide room to incorporate a lot of the educational technology methodologies that we're learning about. As a teacher (I'm currently teaching programming at the undergraduate level), this comment struck me: ""Approaches that make the material feel easy are often favored, but approaches that require struggling to come up with answers often prove to be more effective overall."" I think that these aren't the only two choices. I believe it's more about equipping students so that they feel capable of struggling. That is - the material needn't be made to feel easy, but it must be made to feel manageable. I'm currently taking online courses at another college as well (in Applied Statistics). I recently dropped a course, because the material was just unmanageable. I expect to struggle to solve multivariate problems and such - but the professor is responsible to equip students with the organization, structure, and basic tools that they need to feel confident in that struggle. Does that make sense? Then again, I haven't taken the class you refer to, so my comment may be way off base."	9/6/2015 1:30	386	7	Really thoughtful feedback. Snag her as a TA if you can ;-)
Student56	Student24	1	"Nice paper! I find it interesting that your project deals more with the 'administrative' aspect of education than the learning itself. Do you have any idea how OMCS currently works out this problem? Just a suggestion - to veer part of your project toward a more educational perspective, rather than merely focusing on scheduling. For example, you could focus on the educational impact of what you briefly mentioned here: ""Often times these results in disproportionate size of courses or leave many a student�s taking a course which does not meet their predefined goals or specialization requirements."" Good luck!"	9/6/2015 1:36	233	7	Thanks [firstname].
Student56	Student36	1	"This is a great paper. I think your experience is very interesting. I thought of a slight 'tangent' that you could take, that might add to your project as well as provide interesting OMCS feedback. Can you evaluate the degrees to which various OMCS courses, incorporate each of these three types of learning? I think that might be a revealing study, and in a sense it's really a prerequisite to identifying which tools might be useful in the program. Good luck!"	9/6/2015 1:40	228	5	
Student39	Student34	1	"I very much apologize for the late feedback. I went through the lowerscale IRB certification process while as an undergraduate; luckily the school makes it pretty easy for students. I think investigating peer feedback classroom styles is an interesting approach, especially on a collegiate level where our peers are the best of the best and able to provide hopefully valuable responses. Feedback from peers can happen on a more personal level since it's usually 3 - 5 an assignment."	9/6/2015 1:37	773		
Student39	Student56	1	"First, let me apologize for the late feedback. I appreciate your high level description of the NYS regents as I was not familiar with it. I think your problem area is an interesting one, the scope is well defined - a paper investigating a way for teachers to provide students a self-serviced tool to better understand concepts. Future projects could develop the tool, hopefully giving you the credit!"	9/6/2015 1:50	469	6	
Student39	Student24	1	"First, I apologize for the lateness of the feedback. This is an interesting problem addressed from within our current program. I wonder how this can applied to existing scheduling tools such as Oscar."	9/6/2015 1:57	252	6	
Student39	Student36	1	"Apologies for the lateness of the feedback. I like the idea of information collaboration and distribution. Knoweledge is best when shared. The user interface would be tricky, I would suggest rea[lastname]g about online communities as the experience for information sharing would worth being investigating in of itself."	9/6/2015 2:02	355	6	
Student48	Student25	1	Interesting idea. I'm curious what solutions you will come up with to solve this problem. Various degrees of obsolete hardware/software can be very challenging to address.	9/6/2015 2:58	226		
Student48	Student65	1	"Very interesting idea. I am curious where the ability of the tutor will fall with non-regular topics such as writing, rea[lastname]g, and sciences. Would the agent need to focus on multiple choice student answers, or would some form of AI be implemented for more knowledge based approach to understan[lastname]g the student's answers?"	9/6/2015 3:03	233	6	
Student48	Student80	2	"Very interesting idea. I think this will be a comprehensive method for investigating how game theory can be used an analogy of student performance, and possibly as a way to direct their goals. How would you explain this concept to a student, so that they would choose to make these decisions? ie. group study vs individual study."	9/6/2015 3:07	268		
Student48	Student8	1	"Very interesting idea. I'd be curious to know the impact of humans coping with distractions in general and an child's ability to focus. Like you mention a screen seems to grab the attention. The National Safety Counsel have an interesting paper on distractions while driving, that you might find some interesting analogies to a child being able to focus on a gam, http://www.nsc.org/DistractedDrivingDocuments/Cognitive-Distraction-White-Paper.pdf"	9/6/2015 3:11	393		
Student34	Student24	1	"It'll be really interesting to see how this goes. Have you thought much about how to deal with the constraints that aren't necessarily easy to predict well in advance? The TA time available, for example, seems to only get figured out at the last minute after they take a look at demand and start talking to more people about whether they'd be willing to do it."	9/6/2015 5:27	267	6	
Student34	Student13	1	"I'm curious about how you plan to bring in the connections to other communities like Google+ and Facebook, given that the official OMSCS data pool doesn't seem as if it's likely to have any data that reflects that. Are you going to do a survey of some kind to try to make connections between the original data and additional data you gather?"	9/6/2015 5:32	263	7	Thanks! This review was very helpful and I look forward to the next phase of research as well as all feedback that comes from it!
Student34	Student36	1	"This could get really interesting if we have enough active teams in EdTech that you can use their team behavior to study collaboration and how to enable it with tools, especially since cooperative research is obviously going to be a big item in this class. I wonder whether there's any way that you can get some advance estimates of how many times we're likely to end up with (and how large they're likely to be) ahead of the actual proposal writing to help you decide if that's likely to be a fruitful path to follow."	9/6/2015 5:36	413	5	
Student34	Student38	1	"This has the poten[firstname]l to be a great project. It's such a huge problem that I imagine you'll probably have to do as [firstname] suggests and pare it down to some very small subset that would make a good base to build from, but I love the fact that you'll be doing something that protects Georgia Tech's good name."	9/6/2015 5:43	2083	6	
Student55	Student82	2	"The thought vector approach you're suggesting shows real promise - the challenge will be figuring out how to decide whether two thought vectors are similar or different, but you'll tackle that as part of the actual project. This paper manages to be very well-researched and quite concise at the same time, which is a nice thing to pull off. Your idea of summarizing the key next steps at the end is an excellent one, which I stole for my Assignment 2."	9/6/2015 7:57	340	6	
Student55	Misc3	1	"This paper shows a lot of thought about the domain, which is good. It would be even better if it included some comments about the field of student development models and what's currently being done to detect student engagement - e.g., the kinds of analytics outlined in http://jime.open.ac.uk/article/download/2014-07/526/. Much of the detail you added around specific collectable data is probably not necessary for this assignment - but I enjoyed rea[lastname]g it, and it will give you a great foundation for your project proposal."	9/6/2015 8:03	850		
Student55	Student37	1	"This paper does an excellent job of explaining and motivating the problem you want to tackle. I think it falls a little short in giving the reader a full picture of the domain. Are there existing educational tools that are aimed specifically at encouraging creativity and drive? If so, what are they? If not, what do educational tools in the corporate environment generally focus on now, and how is that different from what you want to do? Answering one of those questions could have complemented the picture of the problem with a picture of the context surroun[lastname]g it."	9/6/2015 8:17	206		
Student55	Student85	1	"Impressive - and encouraging - that you've already started talking with teachers! It's come up on the forum recently that EdTech entrepreneurs often fall into the trap of buil[lastname]g in a vacuum without actually checking that educators will want or use what they're creating; it's heartening that you're avoi[lastname]g this pitfall. This paper does a great job of describing the problem you plan to address. I'm not as clear on what your next steps are, and what details you need to figure out before you can start. That may be a function of everything being figured out already, since it sounds like you're a bit ahead (already starting on implementation) - if that's the case, I think it would be fine to describe the key decision points that you hit while planning your creation, and what you learned that made you resolve them the way you did."	9/6/2015 8:21	311	6	"[firstname], documenting my decision points does seem like a good idea, both for discussion in future course documentation but also as a history of the project itself. After the fact, it's not always clear why certain design and implementation decisions were made and this usually only becomes apparent once an app's shortcomings are revealed in production or during an attempt to build on the application after deployment."
Student92	Student39	1	"Hey [firstname]y, I think that is a very noble subject to develop solutions for. As a person who's both gone through and taught an underprivileged school, I think that this is where technology could make the most difference. Essen[firstname]lly, cheap and effective education technology solutions could bridge the gap between educational opportunities for the privileged and underprivileged. I'd love to learn more about how your application would work. I think that a lab buddy would be a great idea. It's definitely a place that students can often feel very lost since most education does not focus on application of subjects we have learned."	9/6/2015 9:07	398		
Student92	Student41	2	"Hey [firstname], I think that chunking is a great way to teach and learn. Personally, I've found it much easier to digest as well. I very much liked rea[lastname]g your paper, and I think it's important that you noted that there are times when technology or society is not ready for certain pedagogical or technological [lastname]e. Many good applications have been built before their time and failed simply because the technology wasn't ready. For example, YouTube had many predecessors but it's important to note that until broadband internet service became omnipresent, it couldn't be useful to a large majority of people."	9/6/2015 9:14	381		
Student92	Student51	1	"[firstname], it is great that you are researching this subject. As a person who has grown up with a learning disability, I would have very much liked to have better technology resources at my disposal. This is a largely undeserved population of people who need these applications the most. As far as video modeling goes, I would encourage you to look at https://vimeo.com/blog/category/video-school as well (partly shill, since I work there). There are free, and straightfoward lessons on how to film your own videos better. Improved production value could make a huge difference in accessibility. Good luck!"	9/6/2015 9:21	680		
Student92	Student83	1	"Hey Mike, this is an interesting topic indeed. I'm actually wondering the same things as you since I'm working on intelligent tutoring systems as project. I've found peer feedback to be super helpful in learning, so I think that diagnosis is extremely important. Since education is generally unidirectional (educators [knowledge]-> students) it is an important step in a pedagogical shift to more individualized education. Good luck!"	9/6/2015 9:32	1236	7	I wish I had read this feedback earlier in the week (it missed my first check earlier in the week and I'm just now getting around to checking again). [firstname] made the connection between what I want to do with diagnosis and intelligent tutoring systems before I made that connection.
Student14	Student35	2	"[firstname], looks like you have you topic nailed down. Exploring how to gauge fairness with this platform is really interesting - seems like it would take years of research to get down to it. Humans have a hard time being fair as it is, and we have had centuries to work from, lol. The perspective of students plays a big part in this - its hard for individuals not to feel short sided when they do not know complete details of another students situation. For instance, if one student spends hours to complete a task (learned a ton! but received a poor grade) and one spends a half hour (no added learning, but great grade) - would that be considered fair? Im curious to see how we could evaluate situations like these, with the use of technology, more adequately."	9/23/2015 23:58	685		
Student14	Student24	2	"[firstname], you did a great job following the requirements! Thanks for provi[lastname]g references and examples (Constraint Satisfaction Problem). Course scheduling is such a big deal in our program and it was for me in my undergraduate online courses. As scaling increases in demand, manual modification would not even be a an option, due to complexity."	9/27/2015 16:11	540		
Student14	Student39	2	"[firstname]y, I am in love with your research topic! I wish there was a way to share pictures and things on the feedback end. A year and a half a go, I did my own experiment at a local Boys and Girls Club near my office, where I basically [lastname]sformed the program into a ""Google Program."" The children from at this Boys and Girls Club came from the lowest performing schools in the district and the staff at the club were minimally educated. They had trouble keeping fun[lastname]g so they did not attract staff members who could help or that were more educated. Not to mention, they had worst tools to work with than listed in your paper. The main purpose of the children participating in the after school program at the club was so they could do their homework, learn and have fun. But for most, their assignments required them to use computers and only a few actually had computers at home (those who performed higher than average). At the Boys and Girls Club, there were only 2 PCs - for the staff. They were extremely slow and plagued with every piece of malware you could think of, and were only intended to be used by the staff. I tried to get my company to help donate but deadline for that year passed months prior. So I was able to convince a few other engineers (and myself ;)) to donate some time and money. With those funds, I was able to bring in a small group to help ""renovate."" We painted murals and organized what things they had there. We fixed some of the equipment that could be salvaged and extracted the useful info from things that couldn't. We brought 10 Raspberry Pis + 10 Chrome books, a portable projector and plenty of wireless peripherals. I hosted training sessions afterwork every day for about 4 months; set up gmail accounts so that the activity of the children could be tracked, had other teachers come in to help train the staff, etc. In short, 5 months ago I learned that all of the students made the honor roll (inclu[lastname]g the once ""bad actors"") and how much the technology has help [lastname]sform the club from the staff all the way down to each student!"	9/27/2015 16:20	1123		
Student14	Student2	1	"[firstname], your application idea is really neat! Wish there was something like it when I had to take the SAT or ACT! What happens if you answer a question with the wrong answer - would you be locked out of your phone? hehe. I think that is great that you thought about this, seeing that a lot of the time when we have a moment free we are playing games on our phones (I'm guilty of 2048! Well at least when I had free moments). But it would be great to be refreshed on course material. Especially if you [firstname]ed or flagged topics/areas that you weren't as confident about. Even cooler if it had a collaboration aspect!"	9/27/2015 16:39	317
