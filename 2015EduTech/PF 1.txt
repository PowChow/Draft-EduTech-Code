Student10	Student17	1	"Nice to meet you [firstname]! I think that data analysis - understan[lastname]g where fun[lastname]g goes. for example - is going to be a very important part of education in technology. One thing that I've heard is that it's often influenced by political forces rather than scientific forces, and so a politician wanting to appeal to his voters approves fun[lastname]g for things that aren't beneficial per dollar spent, which ultimately ends up de-correlates spen[lastname]g from results. The other thing that I would think is that spen[lastname]g is often focused on problematic schools, which would mean that underperforming schools end up getting more budget in an effort to improve them (although I don't know if that's true or not). Anyway, it sounds like a project with a lot of poten[firstname]l - best of luck, I hope that a startup comes out of it!"	8/23/2015 10:48	392	1	
Student10	Student4	2	"Hi [firstname], great to meet you! This sounds like a hugely worthwhile project - I've experienced the same things with hiring new graduates. Especially in the debugging front, which is a very hard skill to teach but obviously hugely important. On teaching this stuff at a wide scale, one technology that might be worth looking into is Docker (https://www.docker.com/) which perhaps you've already heard of. You could set up Docker VMs for specific lessons, and have students check them out - Docker in Action is a really worthwhile book if you want to learn more about this. Then maybe even set up a web interface for these... Anyway, I am very excited to see what you come up with!"	8/23/2015 10:55	470	7	
Student10	Student33	1	Great to meet you [firstname] - I think that you're right about continuous training being a really underserved area. Have you seen codecademy.com? I always felt like they could be used for internal training as well (maybe they already are).	8/23/2015 11:02	771		
Student10	Student8	1	"Nice to meet you Chris. I do think that special education is a very important area that is quite underserved. I read a story a while back about an iPad app for non-verbal autistic children (https://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/ipad-app-nonverbal-kids-wins-international-prize), which struck me as really innovative. I imagine that there are a countless number of things that you could do in this area. Best of luck!"	8/23/2015 11:15	280		
Student11	Student94	1	"I don't have much knowledge about montessori education, but how much of the cost is child care? Would the technology just allow more cost friendly facilities to utilize the montessori techniques? Or is this catered more towards parents who stay at home with the children? Anyway, as with all projects, I think it's a good idea to do something you're passionate about and have a keen personal interest in and it sounds like this is definitely the case here."	8/23/2015 12:06	450		
Student11	mdarden6@gatech.edu	1	"It sounds like you want to use technology to help go away from a one-size-fits-all approach to education. I think it's worth investigating more into how you would leverage tech to eliminate idle time. I read this article years ago, but it seemed pretty interesting and possibly relevant: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120425355065601997. It talks about how Finnish kids are among the smartest (ironically, they don't rely on technology). One thing they seem to do is the smarter kids who finish early can help those lagging and they focus on helping the kids who are lagging. It also briefly touches upon language differences (which I feel technology could definitely help). I've also thought about some classroom software where teachers are provided with tools to assess students more frequently and get analytics on where students may be lacking and need more instruction. A quick googling shows there are some startups focused on this: http://get.quickkeyapp.com/, http://gradeninja.com/."	8/23/2015 12:14	999		
Student11	Student99	1	"Ah, democratizing education. What a wonderful goal. :) I sort of feel that education already is getting there with all sorts of free resources online. The main barriers for the underprivileged, I think, are access related � having the necessary computer equipment and internet availability. I think rather than looking into expan[lastname]g the OMSCS ideas to undergraduate, what needs to be researched is whether the OMSCS program is more effective in teaching students than other MOOCs due to the ability to earn an accredited degree. How does this compare to MOOCs with certificates like the Coursera specialization track. Also of note is what metrics you'd use to track effectiveness and how they are measured. I also think you should hone in on a segment of the underprivileged. Are we talking about poor kids in the US? Or are some poor kids in a remote area without access to the internet and/or computer hardware. I think they both lack opportunity for education, but the problems are entirely different and will obviously point your research in a different direction."	8/23/2015 12:31	566	6	
Student11	Student61	2	"That's a curious problem. Almost like a rosetta stone for programming. I couldn't click through the link, so I don't have the full details on the assistive agent. I can speak from personal experience that it's not really that hard for myself to pick up new language syntax � the hard part is learning the nifty little things a language is capable of that you have no idea otherwise. What would be neat would be to have some sort of code detection where the agent detects a common pattern (e.g. manipulating a list of strings) and uses that as a teaching moment for showing a piece of syntactic sugar in the language. I learn best by doing, and this is a [lastname]forcement of that. Good luck! I'll be keeping an eye out for what you end up going with."	8/23/2015 12:40	578		
Student6	Student47	1	"Is ""puzzle platformers"" an accurate term? You state that you don't have any classroom experience with educational technology, but you seem to have a decent idea of where you are and where you need to go. I would have loved to hear more about your topic. You state that it is a complex one, and it wasn't really a part of the assignment, but I would have enjoyed rea[lastname]g more. I look forward to seeing more detail in the forums or in future assignments. Good luck!"	8/23/2015 11:16	3465		
Student6	Student41	2	"Wow, I loved rea[lastname]g this. You grabbed me with the intro, and kept on delivering to the end. The only thing that is missing is the name. I'll be wondering forever who this is. I'm 39, and have similar childhood experiences to you. Look forward to seeing what you do in this class, whoever you are... :)"	8/23/2015 12:14	352		
Student6	Student24	1	"[firstname], great to meet a fellow health care IT professional. We seem to have taken similar classes as well. I appreciate the information that you provided in regards to your poten[firstname]l projects. However, you didn't mention a specific tie-in to educational technology for the speech to text Watson project. I can imagine several, but I didn't see anything listed here. I look forward to seeing what you work on in the months ahead. Good luck!"	8/23/2015 12:20	411	6	"Thank you [firstname], [firstname] Greatly appreciate the feedback. I was under the impression that we had to provide more specifics and details for Assignment 1, so I kept my Personal Statement just to share some project Ideas."
Student6	Student81	1	"Wow, it always amazes me to find someone with more kids than myself (I have 5). I seem to be attracting peer reviews of people with healthcare projects or backgrounds. Myself, I started my career 20 years ago for a start-up that wanted to assist remote health care professionals to support chemotherapy patients, so I am well aware of the issues regar[lastname]g tele-medicine. I enjoyed rea[lastname]g about your experience and your goals for yourself in this class. Your paper strikes a good ba[firstname] between those two points. Do you have any concerns with being able to get access to the data that you will need for your research? Overall, you seem to have a firm grasp both of what you need and want to do. Good luck!"	8/23/2015 12:27	1039	6	Thanks Car for your feedbackl. I am hoping that the data will come although I admit that I do not have a clear plan as of yet. Time will tell.
Student67	Student30	1	"Very impressive background Ned and I can feel your passion to get started and helping out in the educational technology sector. To me, the Ed Tech Wiki is a very interesting idea and something I've been pondering for a while. I believe educational resources are way too scattered around the web and it's time to bring to the spotlight the best ones out there. I would to bring structure to those resources so other folks can benefit. Anyway, your personal statement is very good and I understood your points clearly."	8/23/2015 13:03	798	6	"Thank you for the feedback, [firstname]. Yes, I spotted the Wiki after my original post. It is a good start, as Prof. Joyner indicated - I have been rea[lastname]g through chunks of it this past week - but as with all things could certainly be taken to the next level. I agree that more depth and breadth would be very useful."
Student67	Student15	1	"I thought you personal statement was very good. One thing I would recommend is to expand on your idea of Intelligent content tagging. I think I got somewhat of what you mean but I am struggling to find a good use case. Do you mean the content online learners will get will be more ""live"", [lastname]ing everyday/weekly/monthly? How is that of a benefit? or do you mean our content will be tailored more towards an online learner based on some sort of personality test? Either way, this is a very interesting approach."	8/23/2015 13:17	672	6	"I thought the personal statement was not about going into details, but I can understand the concept needed to be clearly communicated for someone to provide healthy feedback."
Student67	Student79	1	"I think you've raised some valid points regar[lastname]g throwing technology at kids. I think we are at very early stage in this practice of using things like an iPad/Chromebooks/etc for kids and we are still yet to see what are the real consequences. However, I am in favor of trying out anything so the community as a whole can benefit when it is learned that certain practices are more effective than others. Anyway, I thought your personal statement was clear and easy to read. Good job!"	8/23/2015 13:28	1365	6	
Student67	Student2	1	"[firstname], I thought your personal statement was very good and can see your passion for educational technology! Team-based online learning is also an interest of mine. My interest is more focused towards the motivational side, what is the motivation for one student to collaborate and interact in an online setting with another student? to help each other learn? network? not feel lonely? I think we need to understand the psychological side of why people in general collaborate and take this understan[lastname]g to develop tools that will allow for organic collaboration to take place. However, I am also a big fan of doing POCs and throwing out there to see what works. Anyway, your interests are very intriguing and definitely worth pursuing!"	8/23/2015 13:53	866		
Student61	Student74	1	Sounds like you have a great background for this course. You probably already have a good idea on the project you want to start. I look forward to hear more about the unconventional approaches you used for students with disabilities and how you may be able to incorporate that into a research or design project.	8/23/2015 13:28	383		
Student61	mdarden6@gatech.edu	1	"I assume you are in Texas? If so I would have liked to see how you switched to teaching from tech field. I almost did that many years ago but the certification process in TX was very difficult at the time. I highly suggest you check out this paper from Dr. Joiner http://www.[firstname]joyner.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JoynerGoel_CogSci2015_Distribution.pdf , it sounds like you may be looking for a similar type of project! I look forward to seeing the project you decide to work on!"	8/23/2015 13:34	875		
Student61	Student94	1	Being a child of a Montessori teacher I am very excited in what you decide to come up with! I highly suggest you start looking into the instructionalism vs. constructionalism literature in the resources. http://www.papert.org/articles/const_inst/const_inst1.html	8/23/2015 13:49	347		
Student61	Student72	2	"Great insight to you and your motivations for this course! I am the child of a Montessori teacher so I understand the issues you are discussing here, let me know if you want me to link you up with her school in Houston! Sounds like you are leaning towards a research project. Also you may want to check out this paper from the resources http://www.papert.org/articles/const_inst/const_inst1.html , I drew a lot of parallels to Montessori from constructionalism."	8/23/2015 13:55	265	1	I appreciated the encouragement and pointing out that paper from the resources.
Student2	Student78	1	"Very interesting read for me -- and topical! I currently work for a major aircraft manufacturer as a software engineer. While I enjoy the work, I don't find it to be challenging from a computer science perspective; I'm actually in the midst of [lastname]sitioning to a tech company. It sounds like you lucked out and found a great job! Interesting to hear your perspective on the health informatics course. Based on some discussion in the class, I strongly suspect that if you enjoyed that course you'll really enjoy this one. Time will tell. Congratulations on closing in on the Interactive Intelligence specialization. I've gone through and watched the topic introductions for this course, and you're certainly correct that blackboards/LMS systems are considered educational technology. If you're looking for more info on the various areas, I'd strongly recommend going through and watching the intro videos, as well as some of the interviews. I wasn't really sure what areas I was most interested in until I did that. If you only have time for one interview, watch Sebas[firstname]n Thrun's interview on Online Learning. Really good stuff. Intelligent online tutoring's a really cool area. I believe it was Dr. Joyner's focus for his PhD, so I'm sure the topic will be well covered by him or by curated resources. I was a tutor during my undergrad, and did some research deci[lastname]g if that's what I want to focus on here. I'm not pursuing it, but if you want some great starter resources check out the class videos as well as Carnegie Learning (in partnership with CMU)."	8/23/2015 13:32	979		
Student2	Student82	1	"Hey [firstname] -- interesting background! Cool that pursuing AI allows you to incorporate your bachelor's. I think your goal for the semester is an excellent one. It sounds like what you're doing closely aligns with Intelligent Tutoring Systems, which is an area covered by the course library. If I'm not mistaken, it was also the focus of Dr. Joyner's PhD. If you're interested in grouping, I think you'll have plenty of opportunities; the previous statement I read also mentioned creating an agent using KBAI background. Sounds like your TA experience will definitely serve you well. Your mention of K-12 education is interesting. What you're describing sounds like a specific approach (the name escapes me) that's gaining popularity. It focuses on watching lectures/rea[lastname]g material outside of class, and using class time specifically for doing activities or problems. I personally think it's an excellent approach for higher education, but if you pursue it I'd love to see your take on K-12 as well. Your AI TA project sounds really interesting, and I'm sure you have the requisite background. What's exciting about the class for me is that if you produce something polished and valuable, that it could very well be used by the OMSCS program! Speaking of -- if it looks like it's going to be used for KBAI, make sure to program it to take pity on my inadequate writing. I'll be taking KBAI next Summer."	8/23/2015 13:49	1022	7	"[firstname], Thank you for the feedback! I admittedly have not looked through the course library much as yet. I'll look through the Intelligent Tutoring Systems section. I think the method you're referring to is called a Flipped Classroom. I think it shares some qualities, but one of the ideas I really like is to stop forming ""classes"" in the sense that all students start and graduate at the same time. We all learn at different paces, and have our own strengths and weaknesses. It makes sense to individualize education. I think it would help put competition back in the classroom as well."
Student2	Student79	1	"Hi there -- great to hear that one of your goals is to become a better teacher. I think that's an excellent aspiration. Interesting to hear your stance on EdTech. I see your skepticism with regards to enriching traditional K-12 education. Technology is a tool, and there are certainly instances where it provides value and those where it's misused. That might make an interesting research project if you can drill down and study the efficacy of a specific technology in education. Or, you could compare what makes some of the websites (e.g. Duolingo) effective versus unsuccessful competitors. I'm just starting to learn about EdTech, and so I went and watched the introduction videos and the interviews in the course library. They cover most of the topics and technologies of EdTech, and it's surprisingly broad. I think if you check that out you'll discover more areas where technology is making a successful impact in education. Plus, don't forget that our traditional, robust education system isn't used everywhere on Earth. EdTech can provide opportunities for children (and adults) in areas with poor education to gain an (increasingly) equal footing for professional success. Overall it sounds like your background is well suited and you'll get a lot out of the course."	8/23/2015 14:09	632	7	
Student2	Student30	1	"Very cool tutoring background! Certainly very impressive to me -- I'm sure you'll be successful in the course. I like your anecdote on the smart boards. Sure, there are many technology solutions already in place: but how many are ideal? What un-optimized or slow moving solutions could students supplant in a semester (and beyond)? Cool perspective. I'm sure you'll reach this anyway -- but I think you, specifically, would enjoy the interview with Sebas[firstname]n Thrun in the ""Online Learning"" section. Particularly the second half of the video where [firstname] asks him more directly about the course. Like you, I try to think less conventionally about EdTech, and that's certainly an approach endorsed by the interview. Interesting preliminary ideas. There's already some sort of EdTech wiki (saw it in my Googling), but I'm not sure how effective or entrenched it is. The survey sounds interesting, and like the wiki, you shouldn't let an existing solution turn you off a cool idea. Last, I like your idea of using your cloud expertise in the course. Perhaps I'll ask you for advise if I pursue a cloud based tool!"	8/23/2015 14:20	1809	7	"Thank you, [firstname], for the feedback. And the tip - I will check out the Sebas[firstname]n Thrun interview and yes, I agree that there is plenty of room for thinking about education and ed tech 'outside of the box.'"
Student82	Student32	0	"Hi [firstname]. After rea[lastname]g your personal statement, I feel like I know a little about you and why you're interested in taking this course. One lingering question I have is, do you have an idea of the project you want to work on or, at a higher level, a problem you might be interested in solving? The paper is a little shorter than the recommended length."	8/23/2015 13:58	573		
Student82	Student78	1	Hi [firstname]. Ad[lastname]g information about your schedule was a good idea. That information should be useful when we are paired with other students and mentors. What type of research did you do before starting the course?	8/23/2015 14:08	340		
Student82	Student39	2	"Hi [firstname]y. The pictures of your girlfriend's classroom are a nice touch! The author explains why they are taking the course well, and where his interest lies for a project."	8/23/2015 14:13	486		
Student82	Student65	2	This is a fantastic personal statement! I think I'd hesitate to nominate as an exemplary assignment simply because it's far beyond the recommended length of five hundred words and I wouldn't want other students to feel pressure to go far beyond the requirements. The author has several great ideas for projects.	8/23/2015 14:22	445		
Student88	Student7	1	"Your experience in the iOS field echos a lot of my feelings around too many very simple app tutorials and much of them going out of date so quickly. I was unaware of the Swift Playgrounds, but those look amazing for learning and getting started. They remind me a lot of the IPython Notebook for trying things. Your undergrad and masters papers appear that you are very well prepared for a course like this! I think you have some great ideas on areas you can look into, good luck. The one question I had was around loa[lastname]g grades into blackboard for 400 students. Any interest there in fin[lastname]g a better way?"	8/23/2015 14:18	561		
Student88	Student22	2	"Your background and experience is amazingly well suited for this course. I am glad that you choose to take it and hope you can continue to share more of your wisdom with us all! The scaling problem of how to teach more and more people is a very interesting one. I have always found, especially as someone very introverted, that as soon as a class gets too big many people will outright refuse to participate even if the course is online. So while we can research technology to host out a course to many more people, keeping them involved and engaged is equally important. I found your first observation around students not knowing how their phone works and the whole process of something like a Google search, very timely. I work with people who have been in the business longer than I have been alive. Everyday I realize there is simply so much I do not understand and get to have rich information shared with me. It is a great experience, however I still have a technical degree and obviously am working towards my masters. Getting folks who are completely outside the technology field filled in on how technology works is essen[firstname]l for the future. I recall the recent Newsweek Code edition as an example of others recognizing the need as well."	8/23/2015 14:27	467		
Student88	Student91	1	I think your ideas are well thought out and could be very applicable to the field of education technology. I recall in the KBAI course having a thought experiment on the final around how we could collect and answer the most commonly asked questions in the course. This way an AI could answer those questions and save the TA on time. Maybe it is time for you to write that agent!	8/23/2015 14:35	537	7	
Student88	Student101	1	Your observation around using video and visual aids to assist in learning and teaching is very accurate and helpful. Whenever I find myself at work debating something and we get no where I make people draw up what they mean and it usually ends the conversation one way or another very quickly. It is amazing how the process of communication and [lastname]slating the message in our heads can be so difficult in understan[lastname]g and how a single image can clear up and solve the misunderstan[lastname]g. Good luck!	8/23/2015 14:44	180	7	
Student78	Student38	1	Very nice introduction. As one of the students of the summer 7637 I think you guys did a good job gra[lastname]g!	8/23/2015 14:35	132	4	This is kind feedback on a personal basis but is not feedback on the paper.
Student78	Student39	1	"Nice job on explaining your professional experience, that will come in handy when choosing teams."	8/23/2015 14:37	142		
Student78	Student65	1	Great job on the introduction. A teacher would be a nice addition to a more technical team!	8/23/2015 14:39	149	5	
Student78	Student32	1	Good introduction. Nice that you have both tutoring experience and technical knowledge. That should come in handy in one of the groups for this class.	8/23/2015 14:42	82		
Student65	Student88	2	"One non-content related note I would make is that there were a few typos or grammar issues in your submission, so one last proof-read might be helpful. That out of the way, I found your paper very informative and it certainly met the goals of the assignment. I think lot of people feel like you do when first asked what educational technology experience they have. I am an educator, so I have some experiences in what many think of when they hear that question. But what is often forgotten is that in industry (which I was also once a part of) we all teach and learn from each other, so many people like yourself have more experience in ed tech than might be seen at first g[firstname]. I really like what you did with the online quiz program you developed. In fact, that is one of my possible projects for this class. There are lots of formative assessment tools out there, such as Socrative (www.socrative.com), that provide quiz opportunity. And at first I thought these types of apps were the best thing since sliced bread. But in the end, they only give information about right vs wrong answers, question/answer types are limited, and the format is not very useful for higher level math courses that require lots of handwriting to effectively evaluate student work (one of my classes is honors calculus). But what you did was provide additional data such as pointing the student in the direction they should focus on next. Collecting and analyzing the results of an online quiz like this and provi[lastname]g student feedback is a poten[firstname]l project that I might look into myself, and it was helpful to hear that you have successfully tried something like that. Nice job."	8/23/2015 14:20	1269	6	"""were a few typos or grammar issues in your submissions"" Very fair... I was writing it on the plane ride back from Germany :("
Student65	Student40	1	"Your experience and the things you've created are very interesting. I am an educator, and I think when people first see ""educational technology"", they first think of what is going on inside the classroom and direct involvement with students. But the teacher back-end is often neglected, and a lot of what you have developed fits specific needs to make the lives of instructors easier and THAT em[lastname] them to spend more time on teaching rather than logistics. Those very important components are the things that school board members just don't see when they visit classrooms. In my school district, we have tools in place that do several of the things you developed your own to do, however, sometimes they are clunky or the data output is less than useful. Home growing your own solutions ensures you get exactly what you want. That is commendable. Nice job."	8/23/2015 14:59	650		
Student65	Student38	2	"Hello again [firstname]! We had KBAI together, and you might not know this but I learned a great deal from you via Piazza posts and your exemplary assignments. From a personal perspective, I appreciated how you mentioned staying home with your children. I took a 10 year break between being an engineer and [lastname]ing careers to become a teacher in order to stay home with my two boys. That 10 year break, though the best thing for me and my boys, really knocked me down professionally. My skills are very rusty and outdated, and I often feel like I am not up to par with others in OMSCS. On top of that, I am teaching high school computer science, and although I love it, I sometimes get caught into the very fundamental basic mindset of what I teach daily. This bothers me and I often neglect to mention that mysterious decade of absence when discussing my background. It was refreshing to me that you mentioned it. All of that personal reflection out of the way... I really liked your personal statement. The experience you have as a parent cannot be underestimated, and by TAing you were able to get a good feel for ""the other side of the classroom"", and I think you are right on target with the ideas you have regar[lastname]g academic integrity. This always and issue for instructors, and it certainly is for me. One thing from my own experience that you might find interesting is that in three different CS courses I teach, I find the cheating to be a bigger issue in the lower level intro class than in the other two follow-on courses. I think this is due to the fact that many students take the intro class not knowing exactly what CS is, and as a result, there is a large population of students in the sections of that class who end up just not caring about the subject, often feeling they got into something that was more than they bargained for (sometimes these are of the mentality ""I like video games. Video games involve computers. I like computers. I must be good at computer science"". Those students end up not having motivation to learn because they just don't care. In our program, I don't think that could be as much the issue as the occasional student who isn't really interested in learning, but who is forced to gain continuing education credit or a degree by their employer, or who wants an MS to increase their salary base. Cheating has been around forever and it will always be around. I'd be very interested in what you come up with for a project, as it sounds like whatever you develop would be applicable not only to MOOCs, but to my own classrooms as well. Great job."	8/23/2015 15:11	1266	7	
Student65	Student32	1	"I know it's been a long time, but the concept behind the pre-calc program you wrote has manifested itself in various forms in modern ed tech, in places like Socrative (www.socrative.com) and many others, so you were certainly an innovator back in the day! The feedback aspect of it was most interesting to me. I am a high school teacher, and one of the things of interest to me is a similar concept to what you did, but existing options are not well tailored to higher level math and the implicit need to use natural handwriting to both solve and evaluate problems. I am new to teaching CS, and I would be personally very interested in learning about your experiences in tutoring the subject and learning about what types of concepts gave people the most trouble, and how you helped them reach understan[lastname]g. My email is Student65 if you wouldn't mind sharing your experience. I look forward to hearing about the project you ultimately develop or research for this class. Nice job."	8/23/2015 15:33	1643

I appreciated the personal connection you provided with the story of your wife and the evolution of the economic (and thus the educational) situation in your community. I agree with your assessment that policy is going to be what turns around these communities. I do hope that technology can play a supporting role, however. I would like to have learned more about what specific areas of interest you would like to focus on in this class, but with your background, I am sure you will find an interesting topic!"	8/23/2015 14:07	2119

Your project idea sounds interesting, and as someone who took KBAI in the summer, I do understand your illustration. At first g[firstname], it seems like such a cognitive tutor would be more challenging to construct than the sort of agent it would be advising, but I would be interested in learning more about how this is actually implemented. Good introduction, and intriguing project."	8/23/2015 14:42	995		
Student59	Student13	1	"Very thorough overview! It sounds like you understand your background and experience very well, and are working hard to leverage them to move forward. Your identification of the current methodological gaps in assessing educational outcomes was interesting, and should provide a good base for your work going forward. I might advise contacting some of the author's of some of the more well conducted studies, and ask them why they did not choose specific analysis methods. This might yield some interesting insights into road blocks you might encounter. I do feel like you could have communicated the essen[firstname]l points of this in a more concise fashion more suitable for the assignment. However, your ini[firstname]l research and thoughts are interesting and worth rea[lastname]g. Instead of ""trapping"" them inside this assignment, I would like to be able to read and comment publicly. I hope you will consider posting a focused summary of this topic as a note, as I think it would contribute to the discussion!"	8/23/2015 14:59	1024		
Student59	Student92	1	"Great introduction. I particularly appreciated you sharing your experiences in teaching students to code. There is no substitute for this sort of real, on the ground experience when it comes to understan[lastname]g the true challenges of education, so I was glad to see you include this. As for your project, I think you have identified two good areas to look at: intelligent tutoring and gamification. It seems like you're talking about combining these, but maybe I misunderstand. If I'm not, though, I would encourage you to pick one and focus. I believe this will yield a better project for a class of this length."	8/23/2015 15:16	431		
Student93	Student5	1	"Hi [firstname], It is nice to see that so many people take advantage of the MOOC platforms. Given that you have tried a variety of them, you can probably synthesize a common challenged that they all share. From your personal statement, I gather that you are somewhere in between research and the design. On one hand, you would like find out how individuals are using those platforms (which is a research portion in my mind). On the other hand, given you experience in mobile development, you also want to create a tool to address the challenges (design portion the project). If my assessment is correct, maybe you could design a solution which helps understand the usage of the platforms. What analytics can be driven from that? Finally, before deci[lastname]g on the project, I would recommend settling on the goal - is the goal understan[lastname]g existing frameworks? or is the goal addressing a specific problem? Either way, good luck! Looking forward to see what you are going to come up with."	8/23/2015 14:44	16		
Student93	Student53	1	"Hi [firstname], I completely agree with your assessment about the challenges of user adaptation of the new technologies. You have asked all the right questions and brought up the important concerns - especially around the fact that it does not matter how fancy is the solution. We face these challenges on a daily basis, but we do not have a clean way to gauge the user's adoption. Beta tests are good, but they require substan[firstname]l ini[firstname]l investments. It looks like you are in the perfect position to address these challenges since we ""sit"" very closely to the customers. Additionally using BI tools is the right way to go about it. Good luck and I look forward to see what you come up with!"	8/23/2015 14:46	552		
Student93	Student21	1	"Hi [firstname], It looks like you are on track with gamification which is extremely popular nowadays. I like both of your ideas and I am pretty sure they will be in demand from the students in this class. The topic of how to choose what to teach the kids can be pretty complex and it might have to be narrowed down. Would that be a specific age category? What would be the final goal of the software - fin[lastname]g the right level of challenge for each student? When I was a kid, questions like ""what do I need to learn blah and blah"" could easily get me into trouble so I avoided asking that :) It would be very interesting to see what you come up with on this front. Good luck with your project(s)!"	8/23/2015 15:12	679		
Student93	Student9	1	"Hi [firstname], I have to admit I was never into the game playing but I do have to appreciation of the work involved behind designing the games. It looks like you are in the perfect position to bring great contributions to the Educational Technologies with VR and I can't wait to see what you will come up with. What caught my attention in your personal statements is your reflection on failures of the some games. That is a very interesting insight and I am very curious about how exactly you made those conclusions. The parallel between game users and students is very non-trivial -- do both parties have the same motivations? Have you made studies on the type of audience that prefer certain types of games more than others? Good with your project and I am sure it will be awesome."	8/23/2015 15:23	620		
Student26	Student70	1	"Hello [firstname], and nice to meet you. I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your introduction. Your enthusiasm for education technology is very evident in what you wrote. I am also a software engineer and I can definitely relate to what you described as the speed at which new technology is being released. I think there are many industries who are already embracing digitization to a high degree, but education definitely still has room to grow in that area. I think though education is more challenging than e.g. manufacturing, because the process by which people learn is different for different people. Your idea of learning a language while sleeping is pretty awesome though; especially in Europe that would have a huge [firstname]et. Good luck with the rest of your semester."	8/23/2015 14:40	924		
Student26	Student95	2	"Hello [firstname] and nice to meet you! Your introduction was very interesting to read. I am glad to see you are working as a teacher. I know my area has very little CS education in grade school and I have sometimes wondered if I should start teaching myself. So far I have not, but after rea[lastname]g your introduction it became an even more compelling thought. I would especially like to get more young girls involved because by the time you get to workforce the division is very evident. I am also a big fan of your robot! I don't know if you are doing this yet, but you should publish your instructions online so other people could build similar robots at school or at home. Also, here in Augusta, GA we have a very similar organization as LVL1 hackerspace, called the clubhou.se. Maybe you should network and ex[lastname]e ideas of different things you are doing. Have a good rest of the semester."	8/23/2015 14:55	1250		
Student26	Student56	2	"Nice to meet you Mirian! I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your introduction. I think it's interesting when you said you view this course as more theory than technical co[lastname]g. I made similar notes in my introduction but since I plan to write an ed tech tool, I thought there would be quite a bit of co[lastname]g involved too (by choice of course). I think it goes to show how much liberty we have in this course to pursue our own interests. Your area of interest sounds fascinating. I'll be looking forward to seeing what you come up with this semester."	8/26/2015 22:45	1194		
Student26	Student85	2	"Nice to meet you [firstname]! I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your introduction. I completely agree with you that technology is very much underutilized especially in the early grades. I have two children, 1st and 8th grade; and all information appears to be moving in paper format. Also every year I seem to be filling out the same paper forms I just did last year, which I'm sure is yet another administrative nightmare that could be better done with computers. I rarely see computers in the classrooms, and if they have some, it's 1 or 2 machines for the entire class of over 20 students. Obviously I'm biased since I'm so into computing, but I want to make sure both my children are very familiar with computers and technology. I think you are definitely on a worthwhile path planning a system to computerize manual and redundant tasks to allow substituting it with more meaningful efforts. I look forward to seeing what you come up with this semester."	8/26/2015 23:05	1180	6	
Student29	Student76	1	Looks like we are of the same 'vintage' computer club! Great personal statement. I am actually excited to see what you develop for this class - very cool idea and sounds like a good way to leverage the Kinect in a unique way.	8/23/2015 15:37	169	6	
Student29	Student51	1	Very well done. I like the clear explanation of the area you are interested in. Looking forward to hearing more about it.	8/23/2015 18:26	106		
Student29	Student50	2	Very well done. All of your propositions sound very interesting. Well thought out.	8/23/2015 19:04	131		
Student29	Student34	2	Great paper. I am really intrigued by what you have planned for CCA.	8/23/2015 19:07	66		
Student74	Student81	1	"I imagine serving as a volunteer for a scout group offers a lot of very interesting teaching opportunities! It seems like from your current job you are not a s[lastname]ger to managing a large group of delicate data, that probably will come in very handy if you do, indeed, decide to go down the research path. The topics you discuss sound very interesting. Nonetheless, they seem to be enormous at the time! If I understand the scope correctly, you may need some quality partners during this semester. Best of luck!"	8/23/2015 15:45	340	6	Thanks [firstname] for the positive encouragement.
Student74	Student6	1	"I can completely sympathize with the c[firstname]ng of ""contributing to the body of human knowledge."" I have to say, the mystery surroun[lastname]g your idea for a project left me intrigued. Without knowing anything about it, it is a bit difficult to provide any feedback or recommendations, but seems like you have your heart in the right place as far as motivation. The only thing I can offer is: pace yourself! Research alone can easily consume an entire semester on its own, Learning about it, performing it, and creating a project derived from research on top of it... phew, it can be a lot of work! Good luck!"	8/23/2015 15:51	336	6	I am regretting not putting more detail about my poten[firstname]l project into this assignment.
Student74	Student41	2	"It seems you already have quite a bit of experience in the area of Tech Ed, both from the receiving and giving points of view! I share your spider-sense-like tingling for the members of this program. It seems like every one of my interactions leads me to think ""this guy may be the next big thing!"" As a mobile software development (having worked on some project for patient education) I can see where there are currently multiple attempts to incorporate mobile into the mix, but there seems to be so much chaos. In multiple occasions we've had poten[firstname]l clients come to us saying ""we bought iPads for all of our personnel, and we don't know what to do with them."" I truly look forward to read about your research, or the product of it (maybe in Engadget!). Good luck!"	8/23/2015 15:56	421		
Student74	Student24	2	"Hi, [firstname]! So nice to cross paths with you again, and to see the SAAD project sparked your interest! Obviously I am terribly biased, but it seems like you have a great background (and very nicely, well-documented code :) for the Course Scheduler project. I look forward to see you and your team take it to the next level, if you so choose to follow this path. On the other hand, my first fascination with AI came when I read (in a very old AI book) how complex it was for machines to attempt to listen (let alone understand) human speech. Nowadays I am still fascinated I can dictate my grocery list to Siri on my own wrist, and it will make it to both mine and my girlfriend's phones. You'll have a bit of a fan on me either route you choose. Best of luck!"	8/23/2015 16:03	336	7	"Thanks a lot [firstname]. Its nice to meet you again. Greatly appreciate your feedback. Makes me feel confident that I am on right path. On a side note, I can certainly understand why [firstname] is so popular and highly regarded among'st students as there are at least 2 of my past TA's taking this class."
Student101	Student7	1	"I believe Ben's idea of developing a ""roadmap"" for people broadening their knowledge of iOS development is right on. I understand what he means by ""what's next"" after completing an introduction tutorial, because I have been there myself. Uber personal statement Ben!"	8/23/2015 15:27	1459		
Student101	Student58	1	[firstname]'s specialization being an Actuary would most definitely help in the research and development of ANY project. I like the intelligent tutor idea. I agree how it could improve education especially with certain individuals that may have a hard time communicating with other people. One benefit of using an intelligent system is it could make it easier to find a tutor best fit for that student. Look forward to seeing your work [firstname].	8/23/2015 15:52	4495	6	
Student101	Student87	1	"Student87 I feel you are going in the correct direction, and from what I read, you will not fail! I like the idea of implementing the 3D VR with education. I do not know much about VR technology, but believe it can be a very effective tool in helping educate. I understand that Oculus Rift utilizes hand controls which are designed for people that have full use of their hands and arms. Just a thought ... is there a way VR technology could be done to help/benefit physically challenged people too? For example, I have limited use of my arms and hands - no use/control of my fingers and can only move my wrists in one direction. Not that I am looking for an answer, but just something to keep in mind, if that is even a possibility with the 3D VR technology. I understand that something like this could require a lot more time than one semester. Great idea!!!"	8/23/2015 17:07	4333		
Student101	Student12	1	"I agree with how learning through textbook rea[lastname]g alone is one way of doing it, but how using technology to better help people learn is the way to go. It appears that you are open to learn multiple ways/methods of implementing education technology, which I believe is important. I feel if you do not have an open mind, especially with education technology, then there is a good chance that you may miss out on some new, perhaps better means of sharing knowledge. You mentioned language education, how about a better means of [lastname]slation? While learning a specific language either verbally or just to be able to read/comprehend it, usually requires more time for an individual. How about developing a [lastname]slator with the use of education technology either for a specific language or for multiple languages? That way people that do not know the language can still effectively communicate, thus possibly dropping the language barrier. Just an idea, such an idea may require more time then what is available within our time frame. Great ideas [firstname]!"	8/24/2015 11:21	2052	1	
Student42	Student26	1	"I enjoyed hearing your motivations for joining the OMSCS program, because they mirrored my own closely. I also think you've also identified a good achievable scope for your project goals."	8/23/2015 15:54	741	5	This helped validate my thoughts
Student42	Student35	1	It sounds like you have an extensive background in educational technology that will allow you to identify some specific areas for research and project development.	8/23/2015 16:07	334		
Student42	Student71	1	"I enjoyed hearing about your experience prior to your CS education. I took a similar arc after sputtering out on my first attempt at college and working several years in grocery and computer retail jobs before returning to college and working on my CS degree, and those dead end jobs were where I developed the soft skills that prepared me for my eventual ""real job"". I think both of your research options are good ones, and I think the second one in particular could be very impactful."	8/23/2015 16:12	703		
Student42	Student36	1	"Sounds like you have a lot of relevant experience that should allow you to contribute a lot of practical design ideas to whatever project area you choose. Congratulations on your impen[lastname]g completion of the OMSCS curriculum, I'm sure that has required quite a bit of dedication to complete this quickly."	8/23/2015 16:24	233	6	
Student85	Student95	2	"[firstname], great introduction! Make me wish my kids: A) were of middle-school age; and, B) lived in your school district! The shop classes I took as a boy were rarely of particular note, but your classes sound really cool! My first thought for you is something of a contradiction. Have you considered doing a research project to determine the value of classes like yours to student outcomes such as dropout rate, graduation rate, college acceptance rate, etc? I say it's a contradiction because you are clearly a ""doing"" person rather than a ""talk about it"" person; nevertheless, if you believe (as I do) that classes like yours are ones that we want to offer to many more students than we currently do, the evidence that convinces school boards and curriculum directors has to come from somewhere. Perhaps this is the time and place to start the collection and analysis of this data? Of course there are more action-oriented approaches for you to take. I've seen some comments in Piazza and elsewhere about developing tools to teach co[lastname]g - perhaps you've already seen or written some of them? - to school children, which would be very cool. I think it's clear that co[lastname]g teaches disciple, patience, focus, and logical thinking, all of which benefit students greatly. Good luck this semester!"	8/23/2015 16:01	672		
Student85	Student70	1	"[firstname], I'm excited to see the enthusiasm you have for education! Now the question is, how to [lastname]slate that into a project for CS6460 and beyond? Your thoughts about modular development and deployment are particularly interesting to me. Have your read a book called Lean Startup? In it, the idea of a Minimum Viable Product is discussed as a basic buil[lastname]g block of a new enterprise. The objective is to build the smallest product that provides value to its user(s) and get it into operation as soon as possible. Then, the team would iterate, repeating the process with a small set of enhancements, as you allude to in your introduction. I thought you might find this interesting since I have been highly aware of that idea since rea[lastname]g the book a couple of years ago. As a software developer, perhaps your project could be some sort of educational software that builds frequent updates into its deployment model? Good luck!"	8/23/2015 16:18	434		
Student85	Student60	1	"Saurav, I'm glad this class is going to give you the opportunity to merge two of your personal interests and I hope you choose to work on a project that challenges you to integrate the two fields. As a veteran of 2 OMSCS classes, I have to agree with your assessment of the technical environment faced by students: There are too many tools with too much functional overlap and too little integration between them. I certainly support a more seamless approach and agree that combining class projects with the goal of replacing the Piazza/T-Square/Udacity triangle with an integrated solution would be good for the school. I will say, relative to your interests, that this seems like a rather or[lastname]ary design/development project. Where is the challenge for you in integrating technology with learning/cognition? Perhaps the answer lies in pursuing both ideas such that the resulting OMSCS learning environment includes the social connectedness aspect. I like to work alone, so I don't feel that lack of connectedness strongly, but I'm sure others do and I'd encourage you to pursue that angle."	8/23/2015 23:47	490	7	Thanks for the feedback. I certainly got a push towards what I am looking for and what I would be pursuing as a part of this course.
Student85	Student55	0	"It sounds like you have your project pretty well defined and have a genuine passion for the core implementation and the possible additions that could follow along. I certainly agree that all academic programs would benefit from the [lastname]sparency of student reviews of courses. Various existing resources prove that students are interested in this information. It's less clear that institutions and professors are committed to understan[lastname]g and accepting the results of student feedback; however, it would behoove both parties to recognize that there is a variable tension between what professors want to teach and what students want to learn. The most useful courses satisfy both groups, so to the extent that your proposed application leads to that goal, I agree that it is a worthy endeavor. On a side note, I'll say that this fairly detailed project definition was probably intended for the next short essay, whereas the purpose of this exercise was more of a personal introduction."	8/23/2015 23:56	621		
Student28	Student98	2	"I applaud you for aiming to be ""a STEM advocate/mentor to underprivileged children"". That's a noble calling and mission. Early childhood development is one of the areas that I am interested in as well, so please feel free to reach out and ex[lastname]e ideas."	8/23/2015 16:26	993	7	
Student28	Student20	1	I wished there were a bit more details on who you are and what you currently do. Youth is our future. Hope you get what you're hoping for out of this class to help that mission!	8/23/2015 16:42	319		
Student28	Student48	2	"Both of those are interesting ideas. The 2nd idea could dramatically [lastname]e traditional schools and classrooms as we know it. Recently, I see quite a few charter school, maybe that could be a research ground for it?"	8/23/2015 16:48	303		
Student28	Student16	1	Hopefully rea[lastname]g the materials will give you an idea on what direction to go soon. Good luck and enjoy the class!	8/23/2015 16:53	1093	4	
Student7	Student45	1	I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your story. It was interesting that you do not know anyone from your college who had the opportunity to write a paper. I think Am[firstname]an students take paper writing for granted and would be surprised to learn that students in some other countries do not write papers. It sounds like you have a lot of good ideas for both tools to build and subjects to research. Your research idea about isolation applies especially well to the OMSCS program since students are not sitting together in a classroom on a campus.	8/23/2015 17:04	583		
Student7	Student58	1	"I was also a mathematics major in undergraduate. I started my studies concentrating on actuarial science and passed Exam FM and did a summer internship as an actuary, but decided to go to graduate school in economics. The actuarial exam process would make an interesting educational technology project itself. An intelligent tutor to help with exam project might be an interesting project topic. You have a several viable project ideas."	8/23/2015 17:13	947	6	"I hadn't thought of the actuarial exam process much as a poten[firstname]l topic, but there have been a number of [lastname]es that increase the use of technology and might be interesting."
Student7	Student87	1	Your project idea sounds very creative and ambitious. You mentioned that you want to have the Oculus tag items as chairs etc. Would you tag the items with words? Would the children in your target audience be able to read?	8/26/2015 19:58	611		
Student7	Student12	1	"I also took Spanish from middle school through college and was much better at rea[lastname]g, writing, and understan[lastname]g than speaking. I think many of the existing companies with language learning products focus on rea[lastname]g and writing and less on speaking, which makes your idea unique. You may want to look at Duolingo."	8/26/2015 20:09	776	6	
Student76	Student37	1	"Thank you for introducing yourself, Rocky! I hope you enjoy this class as much as I! Good luck on your project."	8/23/2015 15:13	8401

Student71	Student36	1	"Hey [firstname], I didn't know you work on myOLE. I really like that application I have both posted and read articles from that site. A great way of sharing knowledge and ideas! These are exciting times in technology and I think there are lots of avenues for CS people to provide revolutionary tools to education."	8/23/2015 18:19	511	6	
Student71	Student85	2	"I wholeheartedly agree with your take on technical education being under utilized. It is interesting to get the take of people that are in the ""business"" of education."	8/23/2015 23:31	410	4	
Student71	Student56	1	"I've always wondered about educational technologies for learning languages. I've heard from foreign language instructors that existing softwares (not naming names, instructors or software) are not all they are advertised to be. Would like to see how incorporating current classroom ""best practices"" could be done in an educational technology. Thanks for sharing!"	8/24/2015 22:31	425		
Student71	Student26	1	I think auto-gra[lastname]g tools are a good idea. I wonder if it might be possible to build some AI into them for gra[lastname]g essays as well as software exercises. Could be an interesting approach.	8/24/2015 22:38	512	5	Essays would be way more unstructured and a lot harder to grade since they are natural language. But we plan on doing modular approach and add more gra[lastname]g modules so it can always be extended to allow gra[lastname]g other things.
Student68	Student2	2	This was very well written. You have a good voice and cohesiveness to your writing. I would have like to heard a bit more about your programming experiences. I agree that group work is not done very well in online courses. I would be interested to see a way that it could be done effectively as well.	8/23/2015 19:05	330		
Student68	Student15	1	I was a bit confused by your introduction. I do agree though that online content has a tendency to be too static. We need to do a better job of taking full advantage of the dynamic poten[firstname]l that we are allowed by teaching in a digital manner.	8/24/2015 9:19	242	6	"I will re-read and process, how best to improve my writing."
Student68	Student67	1	I agree that it is difficult to complete MOOCs. I have never actually completed one myself. I have finished quite a few online courses though. The primary difference for me seems to come down to the idea of getting a degree. When I am getting a degree I feel like I have more motivation. I too believe that this will hopefully be more the case with MOOCs in the future.	8/24/2015 15:12	395	5	
Student68	Student96	1	"It looks like you have had quite a bit of experience. I find the router simulation idea especially interesting. Simulations can be extremely difficult to build, but if done properly they can be engaging and educational. I'm not entirely sure what you mean in your conclusion where you say, ""is 'training' a form of user interface""."	8/27/2015 10:22	584	6	
Student24	Student17	1	"Nice to know you [firstname]. I totally understand your concerns about Educational institutions lagging behind in assimilating Technologies. Interestingly these were very same concerns I expressed in Start of course study survey, that although we have made tremendous progress in technologies over last 2 decades, we are lagging far behind when it comes to integrating those technologies in Education process. Great topic, I think there is lot of room for improvement in this area. Although there is no dearth of educational tools available for K-12 level education systems. It will be a great research project to analyze the reasons of slow assimilation of Technological tools into K-12 Education systems. I would love to know how your research progresses."	8/23/2015 19:43	505	1	
Student24	Student10	1	"Hi [firstname], Good to meet you again. I believe we have known each other from other classes (SAD, IOS) mainly through piazza. �My passion for online education is that I strongly think that learning and education should be a lifelong pursuit, and online education has the poten[firstname]l to provide people with rigorous education without having to pay the opportunity cost of going on campus for a traditional degree.� - Student10 Great philosophy, I cannot agree more with your thoughts. I believe that programs like OMSCS are paving way for making higher education affordable for mass community of learners globally. The tremendous success of OMSCS program is living proof of making many of our dreams possible. Your project Idea seems really fascinating and one with real world implications. With open [firstname]ets and [lastname]e in global business, cross cultural collaborations is on the rise. There seems to be a [firstname]et for such technologies which can facilitate easy [lastname]slation and learning process of other languages. I am from India and at last count there were 780 different languages within ust our country (http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/09/07/india-speaks-780-languages-220-lost-in-last-50-years-survey/ ). You can imagine how difficult it is to communicate even within your own country if you move to another state.

Given your background, I can certainly see your passion for the field of your choice of research topic and its practical benefits. I am also interested to see how one can leverage Educational Technologies along and AI to address some real world challenges. Your project seems to have far greater impact beyond the scope of this class. Best of luck!I would be very much interested to know how your final RFP shapes up."	8/23/2015 20:10	1020	6	"Thanks. I am always amazed that with hundreds of students enrolled, I find myself crossing paths multiple times with folks within this program. I feel closer to GaTech students than I did during my Undergraduate degree (and that in on campus)"
Student24	Student47	1	"Hi [lastname], nice to know you. Sounds like a very interesting topic to me. It might also shed some light on the higher percentage of high school dropout across US. It will also be worthwhile to see some demographic matrix for the students involved in disruptive behavior. That might shed some light if certain cultural upbringing have any bearing on the results. It seems you have already narrowed down to specific area of research for the scope of this class. This seems to be largely untapped field with lot of poten[firstname]l for growth. The project sounds very promising and one with real world implications. I would be very interested in the results of your study. Good luck!"	8/23/2015 20:27	671		
Student51	Student86	2	"[firstname], good to see you again. Looks like your well on your way for the next few assignments let alone this one. I look forward to rea[lastname]g your final paper."	8/23/2015 20:20	238		
Student51	Student76	2	"[firstname], first off congratulations on the new addition to your family. You subject sounds like a good fit for this course and if they end up offering it in a future semester a good fit for behavioral imaging. It would be interesting to see what your results would be if you were to test it on people in the class when asked about different courses/subjects in the program. Also in case you weren't aware the program has teamed up with http://www.proctortrack.com/ instead of proctor U. Prof Joyner, has said their ceo/founder will be one of the visitors to the piazza forum for a q&a."	8/23/2015 20:24	905		
Student51	Student1	2	"Sam, sounds like you have a good start to an interesting project. If you haven't thought about gearing the tutor beyond the your undergrad level you should consider having it span multiple levels. We home school our kids and the history program we have just started for our kids is divided up into four rotating time periods. (Ancient, 1 to 11th Century, 11 to 17th Century, Am[firstname]an & Modern World). The concept being if you have multiple kids of different ages you can have them all study the same time frame and events during a given school year, with each looking at a depth correspon[lastname]g to their ages. Following a similar approach might help your intelligent tutor have greater impact and help provide a wider range of questions to allow a better matching of the students level."	8/24/2015 21:34	965	7	
Student51	Student66	1	"Tim, I'm not sure if were suppose to share the statements we read of other people, but one of my other peer feedback had a similar goal with an adjusting intelligent tutor. Since we don't have one yet on piazza, I might suggest starting a thread about intelligent tutor/mentors. Even if your not looking for a team you might find others to bounce ideas off. Best of luck this semester, I look forward to see what you come up with in this space."	8/24/2015 21:50	420		
Student8	epennington3@gatech.edu	2	"Thats really fascinating. I like the idea of basically having a system that heavily uses meta-cognition. Although it is definitely not the normal use of meta-cognition. When I normally think of that, I usually think of a situation where an agent learns from itself but in this situation, it sounds like it learns from feedback, which is still fascinating idea. One of the things I remember most about KBAI is how we were able to see links between humans and AI and how studying one helps us understand the other. This seems like a great way to explore those ideas further than you would otherwise. I am excited to see where this goes."	8/23/2015 20:42	250		
Student8	Student75	1	"I am glad to see people from other countries in my classes. It makes me realize the broad reach of what I am doing. Also seeing others have a great interest in similar topics gives me hope for bridging to other people around the world and hopefully making connections to people that I otherwise would not. I love the idea of a tool that can help us students out. That is something that I think is great for us to have because its hard to sometimes decide what I should take. Luckily for me I've been able to take what I want so far with no exceptions. Having said that, as more classes get added, and poten[firstname]lly not all classes are offered every semester, I can see a time where this will be of great use. If you need anyone to test this just post in piazza that you would like someone to look at it and I would be glad to."	8/23/2015 20:46	269	5	"Thanks [firstname] for your time and feedback. Yes, the number of students is increasing on every semester and in one point, the time ticket management could be very difficult when you will have lots of student with lots of preferences of the courses."
Student8	Student80	2	"I don't think anything can truly be said to be outside the realm of this class as long as it benefits people in the goal of education in some form or fashion. Game theory if something I have been interested in for a while but have not really studied so this is something I would love to see. I still am kind of debating if I want to publish anything. I would love to have something publishable..but I am not sure how I would go about it. I feel like what i would want to publish would be a cop out and I feel like for what i want to do, I can do something more than just a paper. However, I think I would like to get something done with my project. My project is more towards Special Education and a game that helps convey the contents of Social Stories while also having the fun of games. One of the papers I have read so far basically drove home a point to where people who are agents in their own education might get more out of it.. Thats where I am going eitherway. Anyways, I rambled on a bit, but in the end i don't really think that you can say that this is outside as long as it can truly benefit someone as a student. Or maybe if what you create just benefits teachers it can in the end give them more time to teach and less time to focus on something else."	8/23/2015 20:51	438		
Student8	Student59	1	"This sounds fantastic!! One thing I never got into as a child was rea[lastname]g. For me it was more games. While I've come to believe that they can benefit in very similar ways, books are more widely known and are a much better resource for certain things. I know for me, if I was introduced properly, I would have probably read more books at a younger age. I now can read many books and once I really got into rea[lastname]g, I gained a better ability to read. So to me, something that can help maybe a child find books that they like or help a teacher save time is something that is extremely valuable. This sounds like a great idea."	8/23/2015 20:58	190		
Student38	Student91	2	"[firstname], thank you for sharing your story - you have an interesting background. I admire your tenacious desire to learn more. I think your ideas are very creative. If I understand correctly the #1 project, it would be really helpful for me in ML this semester. I would like to be able to quickly go back to just those parts of the lectures that I really need to review when the time comes to prepare for the midterms and finals! If only my trusty AI could remind me :) The #2 project also sounds awesome, though I know nothing about capturing visual expressions. #3 sounds very difficult, but how cool would it be to just replicate yourself as TA's so everyone gets personal attention! Good luck with deci[lastname]g which to pursue!"	8/23/2015 21:31	24	7	
Student38	Student40	1	"[firstname], it sounds like you have a lot of domain experience in the space where Education meets Technology. You mentioned some problems you've worked on in EdTech, though I wasn't clear if you know yet if you want to continue in that dirrection (I just assumed you do), so please excuse me if my feedback seems to go off in a odd direction. It sounds like you have experience in facilitating communications (very important!) and organization (also key!) of the delivery of online information for students and faculty. If you wish to pursue the next step along this line, maybe designing or planning a tool that would help teachers organize the institution's requirements, or a tool that helps the institution standardize expectations for all classes, would be something to take a look at. A project might also involve reviewing available tools to solve a particular problem at your institution and perhaps surveying stakeholders there on their needs. I'm sure you will come up with something very useful though, as you have seen first hand where some of the pitfalls lie. Good luck with your project!"	8/23/2015 21:32	30		
Student38	Student88	2	"[firstname], I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal statement and hearing about the experiences that have led you to this class. It sound like you have already been thinking a lot about how people learn. I especially found the anecdote about your b[lastname]er dropping one online HS plan for another that had more social aspects enlightening. It makes me wonder how that is addressed in OMSCS, or if it is something that should be a concern for an online grad program. How valuable are the Piazza forums, the G+ communities, group projects, etc. from the point of view of social engagement to success in the program? Is there a way to measure it? Just throwing some thoughts out there - good luck with your investigations into use cases for AI as well!"	8/23/2015 21:32	52		
Student38	Student22	2	"Oh my gosh - you should probably be a TA for the course. I am humbled, sir, and feel like a pretty uninformed newbie to EdTech! I found all your project ideas worthy and interesting. I'd have to say that number 5 struck a chord though, as I have seen the scaling of individual feedback in OMSCS to be one of the thorniest problems, because it is difficult to do, yet speaks directly to scaling quality in the program. A couple of methods to help with this are being employed in this course: Peer Feedback and TA mentors. Others have mentioned using some AI feedback as well, which may tie in with some of the game ideas. I will be interested to hear which project you choose to pursue - good luck!"	8/23/2015 21:33	38		
Student55	Student52	1	"Welcome to the class, [firstname]! Neat to know about your interest in languages. There are a few loosely-connected projects being discussed in https://piazza.com/class/idf8nogyzhh6wf?cid=36 which you might be interested in rea[lastname]g more about, if you haven't already - they have to do with fin[lastname]g rea[lastname]g materials that are appropriate for learners of a language based on their current level. (If you studied Japanese, you'll particularly appreciate this as you look back on the ""bad old days"" of only knowing/rea[lastname]g 20 kanji...) There are also a few resources linked in https://piazza.com/class/idf8nogyzhh6wf?cid=17, but sadly the discussion around them never got off the ground.

Student55	Student43	1	"Welcome to the class, [firstname]! In light of your early educational experiences, it sounds like you are particularly interested in Educational Technology for its poten[firstname]l to decouple students from one another and allow them to go at their own pace or perhaps group them with other students whose academic needs are closer to their own. I imagine many people in our class have similar experiences in their past, so I feel as though if you can come up with a related project getting others to work on it with you should be an easy sell. Buil[lastname]g a course to cover some of the prerequisites for OMSCS material sounds awfully neat! Most of the domains that haven't been covered yet are either mathematical (e.g., probability/statistics for the machine learning & robotics courses, proof-writing for CCA) or programming (e.g., ""How do I use ABAGAIL and Weka for CS 7641?"" or ""How do I use Python/Java?""). If you're strong in those domains, I say go for it, it'll be really cool! One alternative if you're not sure you can finish creating an entire course during this class: you could also work on some kind of tool that matches existing resources to certain prerequisite ""slots"" (e.g., a webapp where students can vote on what the best preparation is for the UML component of SDP). I think I may have stolen this idea from someone on the forum who suggested it to me, but can't find them now to credit them (oops)."	8/23/2015 21:48	616	7	
Student55	Misc3	1	"Welcome to the class, Mohamed! It's exciting to see so many folks who are interested in intelligent tutoring systems. While I'm not exploring that area myself, I know Dr. Joyner's dissertation was in ITS, so I think we really have a unique opportunity to learn from someone who has specialized in it. Your ideas about the kinds of metadata your agent could look at are interesting - beyond the bounds of what we're used to thinking of in this application. It sounds somewhat like work being done by Knewton ( http://www.knewton.com/ ) and the Education Advisory Board, but as I understand it, most of the work done thus far is aimed at a student's overall performance in college and/or a class's student retention. If you're curious about those broader applications, http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2014-nmc-horizon-report-he-EN-SC.pdf has some good starter links on page 13 (though I haven't dug too deeply since my topic is only tangen[firstname]lly related).

There are many who are interested in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, but so far I have not seen a thread discussing them. Maybe you could start one! Amazing that you worked at Academia Sinica. You must have a very deep knowledge of physics. With that knowledge and your interest in Intelligent Tutoring Systems, I feel you could make great progress in creating a physics tutor.

I look at what my father learned and was expected to know coming out of High school and the expectations in higher level learning. I believe that we can be doing so much more for students. Some of that is our fault as a society that chooses to leave no child behind however I think we can [lastname]e that tide with innovative approaches to learning through technology enhanced educational programs. If my 10 year old can memorize 110 pokemon, names, strengths, and attacks, why not the periodic table or something applicable to the real world. I believe the capability is still there, it's a challenge of fin[lastname]g how to inspire the Primary and secondary school age children to learn and apply what they have learned to become that next generation leaders. Good luck with your research."	8/23/2015 21:58	532	1	
Student81	Student47	1	"I think that Assistive Technologies is a great research topic. You are spot on when you stated that Autism and ADHD is on the rise. I know many children with ADHD and my nephew has autism. If there were a program or technology that would adapt and allow those with special needs to move at their own pace and in their own way, this would be amazing. I really believe that it comes down to presenting information in the right way so that the brain can process the information. Although I have not had the opportunity to spend much time directly with my nephew (as he lives two thousand miles away, I can see intelligence and great poten[firstname]l in him if we (as a society) can learn how to break the communication barrier. I believe computers, AI, and predictive algorithms can help with that by calculating what stimulus needs to be presented and how it needs to be communicated. I think of this like programming a computer to calculate the correct eyeglass prescription for someone who can not speak or tell you good or bad. There must be some physiological feedback that is measurable when communication is successful and then learning can be effective. This is all speculative of course. good luck with your research"	8/23/2015 22:08	687

There are a lot of people that need that understan[lastname]g. Linux is an interesting choice for opening that door. I understand the benefits but I wonder if something that has more rudimentary Input / Processing / Output might serve better when bridging that gap. I would not overlook the power of Operations Research in that this topic has a lot of real-world application that makes the bridge between abstract and concrete extremely visible. Regardless of what you choose, you will have a lot of choices and I am sure that you will make a big difference. Good luck,"	8/23/2015 22:19	470	7	
Student81	Student10	1	"Learning a language is a bit of an interesting topic. You are spot on when you state that you must [lastname]force your learning constantly and there is great value in recognizing that we as human beings require continual education to maintain and to evolve. I know for myself that is especially true. I have tried to teach myself sign language 6-7 times and honestly, I have not once given it a fair shake in the sense that missing on one or more of the key 3 -- be consistent, be consistent .. be consistent.. Every day (or every other day) 10-30 minutes.. and never stop... that last part about always [lastname]forcing whatever I learned is where I fail and then slip back quickly. Much like physical exercise. so, at the end of the day, it comes down to discipline.

kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student21	1	"Hi [firstname], Thank you for sharing your experience! I think you have some good ideas. You should def. explore them further. I have some experience in the field of education. As you think of ideas, to deign your software, i think you should looking into various learning models such as ""Child centered Learning"" . In a nut shell, it means that we create environments, where children are responsible for their own learning. Another area you want to explore is 'early childhood education'. Accor[lastname]g to research in field of neuroscience, a child's brain grows at a phenomenal rate in his / her early years. If you explore content available for early childhood education online, you will find that there are numerous techniques available ( based on research) that teaches children all kinds of valuable skills, inclu[lastname]g basic math ( addition an subtraction ) , in a fun way.

kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student93	1	"This is great Student93. I think your cause is very noble and i wish you best of luck! I think you raised an important point about ""Learning styles for individuals"". I think in addition to individuals with special needs, you should also explore the students in K thru 12 grades. I have experience in teaching, in a voluntary capacity for about 7 years now. As a teacher the biggest problem I face is to cater my lesson towards needs of all students in my class. First thing you learn in teacher trainings is about various ""Multiple intelligences"" of students. Some students for example, are visual learners ( they learn best by watching videos ), while others may be kinesthetic learners ( they learn best by doing hand on activities ) etc. There are about 9 broad different classes of learners. You can look it up online. There is also additional wealth of information if you search for blooms taxonomy. I think a product you design can easily be applied/ generalized to students in all grade levels."	8/23/2015 23:19	839	7	
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student5	1	"Hi [firstname], Thank you for sharing! Its great to see that you have a passion for volunteering in your local community. I am heavily involved as a volunteer my self, and i think you will agree when i say that it is a great source of satisfaction! I think those are some great existing products that you mentioned. I personally have not heard of all those products. I have some experience in teaching, and i think one thing us teachers struggle with is knowledge of an existing technology that we can easily use and implement in our class. For example some of us go online looking for cool products to make our classrooms more fun. In the past, i have done formative assessments using online polls, which allows my students to answer questions and write comments, using their cell phones. I would then display the result live on a projector. The process of looking for exciting, new and existing products is tedious, and takes up a lot of time. Perhaps you can think of designing a software, which can take all this effort away from teachers? Where we can readily find all that is we need quickly, ( easy to follow tutorials/ examples etc). Perhaps, it also have some rating system, whereby the educators can rank which technical teaching tool works best in which scenario etc."	8/23/2015 23:33	1001		
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student53	1	"Hi [firstname], thank you for sharing your ideas! I think you have raised some interesting questions. I have experience as a teacher in K thru 12 grades and here is some points that may give you some direction in your research. One of the first thing i was trained on as a teacher was 'Profile of learner' . In a nutshell, it refers to to understan[lastname]g the profile of your age group that you are dealing with. For example if you look for research on profile of learner for students ages 6 thru 9 , you will find there minds are still not quite there, when it comes to understan[lastname]g abstract concepts, this [lastname]es as they grow older and by 12 they can being to understand abstract concepts much better. There is a lot of research out there on profile of learners that you may find useful. In addition, for students in same age groups, you should research 'multiple intelligence'. If you search bloom's taxonomy and multiple intelligence, you will come across various types of learner that we all are. Some os us learn best by watching videos - Visual learners. While others learn best by doing hands on activities - Kinesthetic learners. In a classroom a teacher always needs to be mindful of the type of learners in his/her class. As the activities he / she selects must cater to various needs of the children."	8/23/2015 23:49	1075

Even without anything clearly bad in the environment, some students have expressed a feeling of isolation, which is what prompted the foun[lastname]g of Nerdy Bones as a way of trying to make sure women at the very least have a reminder that there are many others here.

As speech recognition software has improved it has really aided in the delivery of spoken language education, now appearing even in the mobile space. It would be interesting to see how some of those systems can compare to receiving education in a more traditional setting. Having taken a few language classes and always struggled, one of my big problems was trying to speak in class due to a sense of embarrassment. I worried so much that I was saying something wrong that I never practiced as much as I should. Computer based systems could do a lot to help students like myself."	8/24/2015 9:42	600		
Student58	Student87	1	"That sounds like a really interesting project. I think the generally media response has placed far to much emphasis on devices like the rift, hololense, kinect ect. as gaming/entertainment devices. There really are a lot of applications for that level of immersion that can be used in education or workplace settings. Projects like this are what make this class really exciting. After the Rift has tagged the items in the room, would you quiz the student on what they saw? How would the student interact? One issue I would see about the tool as described would be it would be targeted at very young children, they might have issues wearing a device like the Rift. I don't really know the dimensions having never seen one in person, but in pictures they look like they might be bulky relative to a small child. I look forward to seeing how this works out."	8/24/2015 9:52	833		
Student58	Student45	1	"There are a number of tools that could improve the OMSCS experience. For the last couple semesters I had a decent commute by public [lastname]sit to work. I would download the videos and watch them on my phone. It would have been nice to have that better integrated into the official resource, especially since one of the classes I've taken required that every online quiz was completed. I'd have to go back at the end of the day and redo all the quizzes for completion sake. Fin[lastname]g a way to reduce isolation would be very valuable, especially for younger students who haven't had as much experience with on the job collaboration. I'm very hesitant to post in online forums, generally get less out of classes than other students. Group work in some classes has done a lot to offset that, but there is a poten[firstname]l for significant problems doing large group projects with people you've never met before."	8/24/2015 10:06	1037		
Student58	Student29	1	"Using technology to expand the reach of education seems like an important goal. I would think that a significant number of OMSCS students are people who would have been otherwise unable to receive this type of education in a traditional setting. Any thoughts at this point about how you would integrate educational technology into a Montessori education? I'm not that familiar with Montessori and I'd be interested in hearing a little more about it, if you're willing to post on the forums."	8/24/2015 10:37	435		
Student39	Student38	1	"Thank you for sharing. You went into your experiences in a thought-out response that let me know who you are. I like your idea of plagiarism detection, especially in a program like ours where individuals could just copy StackOverflow for credit. I would have liked to seen a bit more about your technical expertise."	8/24/2015 10:30	279	6	"I agree I did not provide a lot of technical background. I didn't think I needed it, but maybe that would be helpful information to some readers."
Student39	Student32	1	Great summary of your experiences and you as person. What are you interested in pursuing?	8/25/2015 13:09	99		
Student39	Student40	1	"Thank you provi[lastname]g background information about yourself and giving some ideas. I would have liked to see a bit more of what you could bring to the table other than subject matter expertness -- maybe some frameworks, interests, languages. Overall, good read."	8/28/2015 21:07	476		
Student39	Student65	2	"[firstname], you are making me look bad with your personal statement! The level of detail is phenomenal. Your subject matter expertness on being a STEM teacher will help tremendously when developing application as you could be the customer. I have been following Google Apps for Education for sometime, so I would be interested in your thoughts toward the end of the semester."	8/28/2015 21:16	377	6	
Student12	Student29	0	Great job! You seem to have a good handle on what you would like to research.	8/24/2015 10:35	202	4	Thanks for the honest feedback. I would have liked to get your opinion as far as the rubric goes as well.
Student12	Student87	2	Great job!	8/24/2015 10:40	155		
Student12	Student34	2	Very interesting. I hope CCA will be improved by the time I take it!	8/24/2015 10:43	228

Student60	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname], I am glad you are part of this course. Your vast experience in educational technology will for sure be a perfect fit for this course. I would encourage you to chose a project which is closer to your interest- May be something related to ""travel & study"", or ""online physics classes"", ""language classes for dummies"". I am sure you have lots of options, and you would be an asset to this class."	8/24/2015 10:27	1181	6	
Student60	Student55	1	"Hi There. First of all I welcome you to this class. Its because of people like you this course is going to be awesome. I am sure you have lots to contribute, and I see you are already on the track. So, all the best to you! I am sure you will be a great asset for this course. On a side note, its always a good idea to mention you name somewhere in you assignment. One reason, is people like us, who give the feedback, would like to know your name :-)"	8/24/2015 10:50	239		
Student60	Student43	1	"Hi [firstname], Your story is really interesting. I love rea[lastname]g it through. I would suggest you to look for some solution for students just like you who are bored during studies. I think you will be able to do some research and find a solution / roadmap of how to deal with such students. Just a suggestion! I think you will be a great asset to the course. All the best."	8/24/2015 10:54	682	6	
Student60	Student63	1	"Dear Yi-Chen [lastname], Its great to see you here. I think you already have some idea of what you want to do in this course, so you should have a nice time in the course. Its indeed amazing to see the revolution of education and I hope you & I can make a contribution to this."	8/24/2015 11:05	572		
Student4	Student80	2	"Hi Student80! Great to know you and your ideas. You brought out issues in your writeup that I cam currently grappling with in my class. Serious and hardworking students are getting demotivated because of use of unethical means by selected few, Hopefully, someone can come up with a cost effective, foolproof system in the class which will alleviate this problem"	8/24/2015 12:58	738		
Student4	Student33	2	Great to know you [firstname]!! Programming for kids is definitely an interesting area and any research work on it would be a great boon to the society. Best of luck!	8/24/2015 13:11	309		
Student4	Student8	2	Hi Chris!! Great to know you. You have chosen an area which is closer to your heart. I am sure you will do wonders. Best of luck!	8/24/2015 13:16	241		
Student4	Student75	2	All the best!! It seems that you are devoted to education in general. I am sure you would do excee[lastname]gly well on a course which is itself about education.	8/24/2015 13:20	255	5	[firstname] - thank you for your time and feedback.
Student1	Student93	1	Really interesting subject! I have not seen a particular study on how to help people with narcolepsy with learning through technological means.	8/24/2015 13:04	405	6	
Student1	Student86	1	This is an interesting area of research. Have you looked at code.org and what they are doing to improve CS education?	8/24/2015 13:11	156		
Student1	Student37	1	I agree there has to be a better way than just emulating in-class education. Are you thinking about using data mining/analytics and then work backwards from that to find a possible solution?	8/24/2015 13:14	226		
Student1	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	This is a really good idea. Current learning management systems have a lot of gaps. I think your plan would be a major improvement!	8/24/2015 13:18	406		
Student18	Student75	1	Hi [firstname] I am from Pakistan and I totally agree and understand from what you meant about your journey from a village school to OMSCS program. The reality is that in our home countries education standards are still rooted very much into the past and education technology is no more than the idea of using projectors and slide shows in class rooms. We have a long way to go. Like you said educational technology has also played a big part in shaping my future and so I am very much interested in this subject. Your idea is really interesting and some other students are also working on similar lines. At first I was also intrigued about learning management systems in general and wanted to work on a related tool. But as I explored more of the course library I discovered �Underserved Communities and Educational Technology� topic and I am now shifting towards it. If you could use your idea to address underserved community needs then I think it will be an even greater outcome.	8/24/2015 12:16	3298	5	"Thanks [firstname] for your time and feedback. Yes, the number of students is increasing on every semester and in one point, the time ticket management could be very difficult when you will have lots of student with lots of preferences of the courses. At the same time, �Underserved Communities and Educational Technology� could be interesting topic too. I am still exploring my project and not decided yet."
Student18	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	Hi Kamran All your project ideas are really great but I am especially interested in the second idea � Measuring Learning. I also agree with you that current available assessment tools and techniques are not enough and more innovation is required here. So my vote goes to your Measuring Learning idea.	8/24/2015 13:12	3678		
Student18	Student99	1	Hi [firstname] I like your ideas and I am also thinking on similar lines. I am from Pakistan and I am particularly interested in the issues and access of quality education for marginalized communities. Our course library has a category for �Underserved Communities and Educational Technology� but unfortunately does not contain any resources yet. I have been googling this topic for some time on my own but so far have not been able to develop any concrete ideas.	8/24/2015 14:13	1306		
Student18	Student77	1	"Hi [firstname] It is good to know you. I completely agree with you that online education has the poten[firstname]l to democratize the access to high-quality education in poor countries. I am writing these lines from a third world poor country Pakistan, and online education has played a big role in shaping my future. But I am also skeptic and know that only a tiny fraction of population from third world countries is benefitting from current online education models. This tiny fraction mostly consists of individuals who are already well established in the job [firstname]et or have very strong educational backgrounds. But for the majority of the remaining population MOOCs and online education models are failing miserably. As for my project idea I am interested in understan[lastname]g the poten[firstname]l and challenges of educational technologies specifically for underserved communities. I am also still exploring."	8/27/2015 12:32	2510

Student9	Student83	1	"Interesting, Mike. If you have hardware experience - I'd be really interesting in seeing a hardware project. I know there have been a lot of companies in this space http://littlebits.cc comes to mind. But especially if you are in the medical device field - I bet you have some unique experience to bring to the table. Looking forward to what you end up doing."	8/24/2015 13:26	260		
Student9	Student19	1	"One of my best friends wrote this as his first program: Do Print() Loop And replaced all the IE shortcuts in the school with that program... Good times. There are a lot of ini[firstname]tives for teaching code - I'm interested, too, but it's hard to know where to start - there should be a thread dedicated to this on piazza. Good luck!"	8/24/2015 13:31	228	5	
Student9	Student25	1	"This is a topic that always takes the wind out of my ambitions, as a developer. I have great ideas about something, only to realize schools might be running windows XP, and IE 6, but they also have some iPads. Anything to solve, or at least profile the space (so I know what platforms to target) would be useful. Good luck."	8/24/2015 13:35	185		
Student9	Student90	1	"I'm very glad I got to read your intro, [firstname], because it gives me a better perspective on your point of view. There is nothing I hate more, than outdated, crummy educational software. There is simply no excuse for browser incompatibilities on something as simple as algebra 1. I think buil[lastname]g something specifically for your daughter would be an awesome project - and, our theoretical debate over gamification aside - I think you are dead on when you say it is the 'teacher's failure to present the subject in a way that creates interest....' I'd love to help out if I can! Best, [firstname]"	8/24/2015 13:38	904	6	
Student95	Student43	2	Nice to meet you [firstname]. I think most of us in the OMSCS courses have been positively impacted by technology. I got bit by the computer programming bug in 7th grade. Good luck in the class! [firstname]	8/24/2015 19:00	147	5	
Student95	Student70	1	"Nice to meet you [firstname]. I am glad that you value education and are fascinated by using technology to better deliver education. With the advent of the Internet, the ability to push out education is getting easier, faster and less expensive. This is a good thing. Good luck this semester."	8/24/2015 19:03	328		
Student95	Student55	2	"Yep, it is called Educational Technology. It is amazing to read the different things that brought the different students to this class. Your OMSCS-advisor sound like an awesome project and very interesting. Good luck this semester, I will be sure to keep an eye out for your project."	8/24/2015 19:09	445		
Student95	Student60	2	"Nice to meet you Saurav. I also took the KBAI class next spring. What an excellent and interesting class. I think your interest in cognitive science and how it relates to computer science is very good. As far as your project ideas go, I think the app might be a little too hard to really connect all the pieces together. I do like your idea of digital icebreakers. My son is a gamer and spends many hours a week on call of duty and other games. I wonder if multiplayer games might be the answer to setting up groups or at least be icebreakers. Good luck this semester."	8/24/2015 19:17	681	6	Thanks for the feedback. It's good to know what people think of my ideas.
Student22	Student58	2	"Hi Dan, A well written paper - I gave an exceeds due to your comments about "" the intersection of topics such as computer vision ... natural language processing.."" it seems to me if we could have an intelligent system that could tailor responses and speed based on student behavior would be a big plus - this what human teachers can do, but having a machine to do it would help - I just think that level is still far away from current technologies - however we have to start thinking about it to begin - very insightful. I also share you concerns about the completion rates of MOOC's (I must admit I am part of the problem for one class I took - when there is no other reward other than saying you completed it - with the Ga Tech program there is more of an incentive.) - but then again if one gets stuck learning a MOOC all alone I am sure the low rates of completion drop even further."	8/24/2015 20:28	885	6	
Student22	Student91	2	"Hi [firstname], Nice paper - quite insightful, things that stand out to me are: 1. How MOOC's can help people learn who might otherwise shy away from learning - some people are very quiet and learn better that way. 2. Reviewing MOOC's is hard - I've noticed that too. Some parts I get right away and other parts I have to review many times and I'm still not sure what they said - or if I get the proper meaning and idea. I'd love to find a better way to learn MOOC's besides screen shots and notes - I know it would help me! 3. I think you have a high goal of coming up with a virtual assistant, but we must take the first step towards that somewhere - perhaps this is the place. Keep up the good work."	8/24/2015 20:43	504	7	
Student22	Student101	2	"Hi [firstname], Straightforward and honest paper. I like that you mention the importance of team work when laying cable with the Marines, working for cable television and the pipes that carry internet traffic. Your comments about the efficient teaching of people (when I am sure you ran into so many different people installing cable) was good as I am sure you learned quite quickly you have to do it different ways depen[lastname]g on the audience. I think you idea of visuals is good - consider that they don't always have to be elaborate to get the point across and still be very effective. Something that I keep in mind for that is how Southwest Airlines started: A pencil sketch on a cocktail napkin - was the only visual needed! I believe you will do well in the class. I see you went on to a second career in computers and have appear to have done very well; I teach computers too and can very much agree a picture is worth a thousand words (I have said the same thing many times while teaching). Actions not words sometimes are a better form of instruction!"	8/24/2015 20:51	975	7	
Student22	Student7	2	"Hi Ben, I'd like to read your paper one day on the economics of student tuition/aid and debt - I know a few students very much in debt. I thought I had was how can MOOC's reduce the cost of education to prevent some of those financial problems later. An idea I have is how can you improve the education experience by reducing the cost? If a student has less worries about debt they may actually do better if they feel they are in control of finances - the younger folks that I know of that have incurred so much debt seem oblivious to whats happening with loans until they get out of school. Your thought about ""Where do I go after I complete HelloWorld?!?!"" in my programming studies is right on - there has to be follow up and a plan. That is also a good idea - otherwise you learn this fact and that fact and then you don't know how to put it all together into a substan[firstname]l project is what I think you are trying to say - and if so I agree with you. While technologies and frameworks [lastname]e, the basics stay the same - perhaps Swift can help with that but I don't know enough to speak on it. Keep up the good work!"	8/24/2015 21:08	950		
Student53	Student25	1	"Hi [firstname], the project is a great idea, had never thought of that from a school standpoint, but with the emergence of virtualization the possibilities do expand. I remember in the company I used to work at, when I started we used to have 2 CPU's in order to be able to run multiple VM's. Later a private cloud was built with VMWare and now there was no need of an extra CPU, just one workstation and from there we would access the vm's in the private cloud. This made hardware resources use much more efficient and also saved tons of hours in configuring systems. The ultimate goal was to even remove the workstations and just have access stations that connected to VM's. I can imagine this being applicable to your project in order for schools to still have physical labs for students to work on, stations that would connect to the VM infrastructure."	8/24/2015 21:04	1263		
Student53	Student21	1	"Hi [firstname], This sounds good and having two poten[firstname]l beta testers at home is great :) If one of your kids gets bored at school, then that ca be an opportunity to come up with ideas for advanced students, tools to keep them motivated and exploring beyond what is taught at school. In regards to the ""purpose of learning"" I think the content should be tailored towards the audience. So for example a kid might be find more useful learning because if they are a super hero and have saved need to save 5 people, if they already saved 2 then how many are left (or something along those lines)."	8/24/2015 21:25	1548		
Student53	Student9	1	"Hi [firstname], Your ideas and experience seem like a great combination for a very innovative project. VR looks like it might be the next big thing, I recently had a chance to try out an Oculus Rift and was impressed, seemed like a big leap in gaming technology. Your last paragraph is spot on, games like Sim City can definitely teach system level thinking. This is an interesting topic, now that election season is up the door, can people become better voters if they play games that simulate poten[firstname]l government policies? Another thing to consider is that usually people play games and get educated almost ""by accident"". Can the paradigm [lastname]e so people rather play games with the primary goal of getting educated? This could even poten[firstname]lly increase the [firstname]et for the game industry. Good luck with your project, I am looking forward to the fin[lastname]gs!"	8/24/2015 23:41	757	6	
Student53	Student19	1	"Hi [firstname], I think that programming should become an essen[firstname]l part of school programs starting from a young age. These days, knowing how to code can help people in any industry. I therefore see the value in the ini[firstname]l ideas for your project. Check out this resource: https://scratch.mit.edu/ I haven't tried it myself, but based on what I've heard it is like ""co[lastname]g for kids"". I think it could help out with the idea you have in mind. saludos!"	8/24/2015 23:53	992	6

Student72	Student24	1	"The speech to text research sounds much more interesting. Carrying on with the project you started in SDA could work, too. It certainly is education technology. I was in SDA in the spring and personally I would rather explore something new."	8/24/2015 21:40	320	6	Thanks [firstname]. I agree with your thoughts.
Student72	Student74	1	"I love your idea for a research project. This area of research is fairly broad, but I'm sure you and mentor will fine-tune it to be more specific."	8/24/2015 21:46	416		
Student72	Student6	1	"Getting the chance to develop something useful for your company and having their pre-approval that you spend some of your time on it sounds like a no-brainer to me. Not only will you be meeting this courses requirements, but presenting your company with a solution to a problem. I'm sure you'll even get the opportunity to continue making improvements to your system."	8/24/2015 21:53	601	6	"I enjoy getting positive [lastname]forcement. I'm not always sure if what I'm doing is right, so it helps to have someone else confirm what I am thinking."
Student72	Student41	1	"Yes indeed, creating a unique learning experience for each student that fits the learning style of that particular student is a lofty goal. I guess defining what you really mean by unique learning experience would be an important first step. I mean would that include tactile, visual, games, documentaries, buil[lastname]g things with your hands, etc. Unique learning experience really has no limits which is a good thing, but probably needs to be limited to be attainable at this time."	8/24/2015 22:03	708		
Student79	Student65	2	"Very thorough explanation of your motivation and background. I am also very interested in high school education and EdTech in our primary and secondary schools. I think many of the problems are very difficult to solve -- I still find some tech very difficult to use and many elementary teachers are not tech-experts. Auto-gra[lastname]g, however, might be a category that could be very beneficial. There can be some difficulty in making the grader intelligent enough to grade things like proper decomposition of code, or steps in calculus. But there is probably some low hanging fruit that could be accomplished in the time frame of this course. I'm not sure of my project, but the auto-gra[lastname]g sounds interesting if you want to partner."	8/24/2015 21:49	761	7	
Student79	Student39	2	I like your use of pictures and personal anecdotes. It makes me feel a little more hopeful about the use of EdTech in secondary education. It seems that you could explore the poten[firstname]l specifics of your project. Maybe just a short brainstormed list would be helpful. I am glad to hear your thorough background and interest in EdTech.	8/25/2015 20:01	873		
Student79	Student78	1	I think it would be nice to hear a bit more about your personal interest in education in general. God thorough explanation of your background.	8/25/2015 20:16	218		
Student79	Student82	2	"Good, thorough explanation of your motivation. I like the idea of an AI grader (someone else in this Peer Feedback group had a similar idea). If you are open, I think I might want to partner working on an AI grader. Your goals for this class seem ambitious but attainable."	8/25/2015 20:20	272	6	"Thanks [firstname]! Also, it's a small world :). I'll have to track down the other individual and see if they want to pair up."
Student52	Student20	1	"Hi [firstname]! Sounds like you already have great experience with educational technology with middle school students and the science and math oriented education community website. That�s interesting that your studies found students responded best to content pertaining to their lives. I can see that being applicable, where students are more interested in something that directly involves them in some fashion rather than another topic that has little impact on their daily lives. I think your project path is solid with a focus on fin[lastname]g new and interesting ways to reach math and science fans/students with technology incorporated into the educational aspect. I recall the age-old question when in middle and high school of students always asking why we needed to learn the math that we were covering. From your perspective, I�d be interested if you try to add that level of depth to the learning process by answering questions like that so students have a better understan[lastname]g of the real-world applications that are derived from the math and science they�re learning at that stage of education. I had only a few instructors that provided excellent examples of how the math we were studying applied to real-world scena[lastname] (especially in Physics). Good luck!"	8/24/2015 23:48	777		
Student52	Misc3	1	"Hi Mohamed, Sounds like you already have some great and interesting ideas around the topic of incorporating AI into a learning management system (like the lessons you created at work) to help better gauge the effectiveness of those learning materials. I think you�re in the right class for getting answers for a lot of the questions you asked in regards to data collection and analyzing/correlating that data with other data points to determine the mood of the student or if there are any parallels between the student�s grade and their participation in the class forums. I can see this being used beyond just this class in many other scena[lastname] where the same type of information could be collected to build a dataset that gives the instructor or research a closer look at how to make the learning platform more effective. Hopefully with your experience in the KBAI class and what you gain from this EdTech class, you will be able to implement a training solution at your place of work that is more effective. Good luck!"	8/25/2015 0:01	933		
Student52	Student28	1	"Hi [firstname], Great introduction and (early) congrats on graduating from OMSCS in December! This is my 3rd semester in the program and I, too, would love for a system that allows us as students to better track our classes and the related material/rea[lastname]gs. There have been many discussions in Piazza around this topic already that may assist you, although you may have already read them- @34, @38 and @66. It�s interesting to hear about your passion with early childhood education as well. I have friends in early childhood education that love the field and the study that follows with the career. My recommendation would be to choose the path that interests you the most and also consider if this project is something you�d continue to work on or follow even after this class comes to an end. Good luck!"	8/25/2015 0:16	1019	7	"Feedback is upbeat and provide good additional information related to the topic and suggestions. It would be nice to have the reviewer's full name, so we may continue to dialog in the class."
Student52	Student98	1	"Hi [firstname], That is a great introduction and sounds like you�ve already grabbed life by the horns and have a clear understan[lastname]g of the requirements for the path ahead. A passion like that can only lead to great satisfaction and reward through the process itself. I relate with you in the sense of having the desire to continually improve systems, because it seems as if there is always room for improvement, especially in relation to technology. I think with some of the topics you mentioned, like big data/storage and interactive learning in education, there is so much information that can be collected and analyzed to find new ways of improving those processes but getting there and properly assessing the data can be the challenge as you stated. One of the earlier discussions in Piazza was around childhood learning, although focused on gaming, may be of interest to you, if you haven�t already read it- @23. I�m sure throughout the course you�ll find other helpful videos, documents and discussions with other students about your interests in particular. Good luck!"	8/25/2015 0:33	1197	7	I think the feedback was very detailed and provided insight on the direction of the final project. The student also provided a team that wants to do the same ideas as me. Thank you.
Student40	Student101	1	"Hi Josua! Thank you for sharing in your assignment! You've definitely had an interesting career arc :-). I am also fin[lastname]g in the past year or so myself that having the ability to make screencasts can be a really nice way for teaching instructors new things (in my position at the local community college I tend to get quite a bit of walk-in traffic from instructors asking about various things, though usually it seems it's related to Blackboard, since that's one of the pieces of software I'm responsible for). It'll be interesting to see what sorts of ideas you come up with for the class!"	8/24/2015 23:40	1332	7	
Student40	Student88	1	"Thanks for sharing [firstname]! The brown bag sessions sound like they'd be fun to attend, it must be interesting working at HP :-). From what a lot people seem to have mentioned about the AI course it makes me wish I had taken it already...I'll have to put it on my list to look at next. Developing good assessments in Computer Science courses always seems to be a bit of a difficulty, since coming up with good questions/answers is one thing, but then assessing student's abilities is another so that quiz project must have been interesting to work on. Engagement in online courses (as your b[lastname]er found out, and we've both kind of seen in the OMS CS program) is one that can really make or break an online program. Luckily the overall quality of the video instruction has been pretty good, as well as all of the help others have provided on Piazza, but it can feel pretty isolated for us anyway (I'm not sure if there's anyway we can directly tackle that with a project in this course, but I look forward to hearing what kind of interesting projects you cook up :-)."	8/25/2015 0:03	976		
Student40	Student22	2	"Hi JT! Thank you very much for sharing your experiences/thoughts! It sounds like you have quite a few ideas worth taking a look into for this course :-). Whenever I'm asked to teach the PHP/MySQL class for the college I work at, I'm usually both anxious/sad because there's so much to share and for whatever reason there's always a lot of difficulty in really [lastname]slating what I know (or what I don't know) and putting it all together coherently for students that don't even necessarily have a programming background. The few students that are actually excited about programming, in turn, excite me to be a better instructor, but it's still a difficult process. The problem of how to teach a higher volume of student remotely is an interesting one...setting up consistent programming environments with good tools can sometimes be a part of the issue (for example, last week during my first class session, I realized that the popular tool we have installed on the computers, PHP Storm, doesn't have it's debugging setup working and it can be difficult to get started with it, which won't work well for a class environment...I'll need to get it replaced on the PCs with something that is reliable/simple to use for the students so basic debugging processes won't be difficult during class). On the other hand, making the environment too abstracted out can ""dumb"" things down too much I feel, where students end up not knowing enough on how to setup their development environment properly, so it's a fine line. I'm sure whatever you decide to work on, it'll be an interesting project :-)!"	8/25/2015 0:19	1021	6	Nice to know other people are experiencing similar problems I face everyday! Makes me feel better!
Student40	Student91	1	"Hi [firstname]! Thank you very much for sharing! My wife's stepdad is also originally from Peru, and while Guadalajara is quite a bit away, I live pretty close to Mexicali, Baja California (I live in El Centro, California). Also, kind of funny is that we actually have a season during the winter down here where all of the ""snowbirds"" come down and spend time during the winter, mostly from Canada (to get away from the cold :-). I thought your project ideas were quite interesting...it sounds like you have a quite of experience in 3D Animation. It would be interesting to see how far along, or what kind of research you'll be able to conduct in this course, especially related to Idea #3 on creating a Virtual AS Assistant. While it would probably be quite a bit of work (I'm guessing the training of the assistant's AI would probably take the longest) I'm curious to learn more about how that sort of stuff works (I really wish I had taken the AI course now :-). Good luck!"	8/25/2015 0:36	805	7	
Student33	Student8	2	Very well laid out Introduction. I can feel how much special education has played in your life from your grandmother on to your stepson. I really hope you are able to develop an idea for a tool that will be useful using AI for social storytelling.	8/25/2015 6:39	226		
Student33	Student59	1	Nice to meet you Sir. The use of AI to select rea[lastname]g material seems to be a very interesting topic.	8/25/2015 6:47	40	2	Not much detail or anything I can use to improve on future assignments.
Student33	Student75	1	This a very interesting topic. I hope that this course helps you to develop this tool. I can see how it will be useful to students.	8/25/2015 16:20	150	4	[firstname] - thank you for your time and feedback.
Student33	Student80	0	"Student80, Well written . You have an extremely diverse background.. I see you plan on addressing the study of plagiarism ..Do you plan on developing methods or strategies to encourage students from doing this or how they could better improve their skillset which would avoid plagiarism"	8/25/2015 16:34	263		
Student16	Student96	1	"Interesting backgrounds, sounds like this course will be a great fit for you."	8/25/2015 8:50	91	6

Student90	Student61	0	The paper is well organized. It addresses the questions asked in the assignment well. I believe it offers enough information to allow the teachers and TAs to match the student with a mentor and update library materials.	8/25/2015 12:36	349		
Student90	Student11	1	"The paper is brief and goes right to the point. It answers all the questions included in the assignment instructions and, in my opinion, meets the assignment goals."	8/25/2015 12:42	181		
Student90	Student83	1	"After rea[lastname]g the paper, I have a good idea about who you are and what your interests are, particularly as they relate to this course. The paper addressed all the questions asked and cleverly enticed the reader to go beyond the suggested 500 word length."	8/25/2015 12:45	478		
Student90	Student99	1	"While this paper covers all the questions asked in the assignment instructions, because it is supposed to be a personal statement, in my opinion, I think it needs a tittle bit more of a personal touch. Good paper, though. I particularly like the addition of the article about the use of videos on education."	8/25/2015 12:58	26		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student49	2	My high school's IT Academy used virtual labs for instruction like the ones you describe (provided by Florida State College). That is awesome that you're involved in that kind of work.	8/25/2015 13:40	177		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student77	2	"That is great that you used available resources to educate yourself. I've always been passionate that Education is an opportunity, not a guarantee, and it seems like you're certainly taking it. My wife is actually working towards a Master's Degree in International Policy, so I look forward to seeing what you have to say about third world educational opportunities."	8/25/2015 13:43	122		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	Student97	2	"That is a great idea for a project. Teaching information security is a huge challenge, but crucial in today's environment."	9/1/2015 8:46	23		
mkhalil33@gatech.edu	jvang7@gatech.edu	1	I think your project management background is something lacking from Educational Technology projects. A way to implement project management skills into Education would do it great good.	9/1/2015 8:47	20		
Student20	Student73	1	"I really enjoyed your introduction and share your views on actually buil[lastname]g products rather than the theory of CS. I also completely agree with the disjointed nature of the OMS program with all the different resources that we have to keep up on. Creating a sort of portal for OMSCS students would be a great project idea. Something that can perhaps pulls feeds of due dates, assignment updates, and piazza posts all together in one easy to access site would benefit many students going forward as the program grows. I look forward to seeing what comes out of your project!"	8/25/2015 13:38	1391		
Student20	Student100	1	I look forward to seeing the project ideas that come from your experience with so many ET platforms. It sounds like you have more experience from an instructor point of view which will surely aid you in developing your project!	8/25/2015 14:47	334		
Student20	Student48	1	"Your idea for a mobile app or game to help with speech therapy sounds like a fantastic idea for a project. I'm sure your personal experiences will give great insight to your project team if you choose to go this route. Also, your idea of distributed teaching with local and central teachers sounds very intriguing and innovative. A very good middle ground between in-person teaching and typical online classes."	8/25/2015 14:52	278		
Student20	Student16	1	It sounds like you have more experience in the educational technology field than most enrolled in this class. I look forward to seeing the project ideas that you may come up with. I agree that educational technology can be difficult due to the breadth and differences in depth of the subjects that need to be taught. Trying to find a one-size-fits-all solution can seem nearly impossible.	8/25/2015 14:57	414	6	
Student49	Student54	2	Sounds like this class is really your cup of tea! Great to hear your starting your own business within the field.	8/25/2015 14:14	201		
Student49	Student14	2	"Great! You sound like a real good samaritan, great to see that these days. I wish you all the luck in starting your school and hope we both get a lot out of this class!"	8/25/2015 14:18	225

Student35	Student71	1	"Exploring ""skills development for [the] disadvantaged"" seems to be a worthy idea. Regar[lastname]g area # 1 (""impart old tech knowledge to new generations""), there is definitely some value in presenting old ideas. Professor Kishore has based his AOS course (CS 6210) on exploring the historic operating systems, for instance."	8/25/2015 19:02	630		
Student35	Student36	1	"From your Personal Statement, it seems evident that you already have substan[firstname]l experience in educational technologies. The class may be interested in learning about the OLE project via Piazza."	8/25/2015 19:13	316	6	
Student35	Student26	2	Excellent essay. It clearly identified your aspirations and motivation. I believe the class would love to hear about your project.	8/25/2015 19:18	242	6	"Yes, more on that in assignment 1 :)"
Student41	Student10	1	"First of all, my hat's off to you for working to learn Mandarin Chinese. I'm not sure that I'd be able to handle the paradigm shift from a phonetic to a symbolic language. Regar[lastname]g your ideas, I think you've got some really great beginnings. The one that stuck out for me was learning the tonal aspect of the language. I'm sure you're already familiar with Duolingo, but one of the things that I believe they do really well is mix up the learning modalities. I used LiveMocha a long time ago and one of the features I really liked was that you could be paired up with someone whose language you were trying to learn. Rather than voice recognition, might this be an alternate avenue? I'm sure there are many Chinese speakers who want to learn English and work on their pronunciations. Regardless of the path you choose, I hope to learn about what you've undertaken as there are many exciting possibilities. Good luck!"	8/25/2015 19:39	734		
Student41	Student47	1	"I wouldn't worry too much about the lack of formal training when it comes to Ed Tech. Having those web architect skills give you a big advantage when it comes to actually implementing a project. So, your notion of improving behavior in the classroom using Ed Tech isn't one that I've seen discussed before, but it generates a lot of ideas. The notion of digital badges really seemed to become popular with Khan Academy and I wonder if there isn't an inverse application here. Could losing your badges be motivation to behave in class? How could you ""gamify"" the classroom to improve behavior? It's an interesting question in a live setting. Hopefully that sparks some further thinking for you. If you decide to look into LMSs, I'm considering a project in which I try to integrate a HTML5-based course authoring platform into an open source LMS. My idea is more for adult learners, but it would poten[firstname]lly benefit students, too. Good luck with whatever path you choose!"	8/25/2015 19:52	825		
Student41	Student24	1	"I believe that you have a great background for creating a really interesting project. I'll be honest, the Watson project is really intriguing to me (the course scheduler is just as noble, but I think the research associated with the Watson project is compelling). The first thing that comes into my mind is, ""What if lectures from top schools were [lastname]slated and made widely available in many languages?"" Even [lastname]scribing lectures for posterity using Speech-to-Text might be valuable. What if there were a Siri/Cortana/[firstname]a embedded within a learning context that could act as an assistant of sorts, perhaps doing additional research on subject matter that's ancillary to the main lesson to help a student bolster their understan[lastname]g? You've probably already seen this, but the Skype [lastname]slator (http://www.skype.com/en/[lastname]slator-preview/) functionality looks amazing. What if a teacher could virtually teach students from around the world in real-time? Whatever path you end up choosing, I'm excited to see what you'll achieve. Good luck!"	8/25/2015 20:07	962	7	"Thanks [firstname]. Like you I was intrigued by the underlying architecture of the IBM Watson Speech To Text services. Being an application developer I can imagine the applications of these services in EdTech tools. From basic language [lastname]slation, speech recognition and real time dictation capabilities, there is tremendous poten[firstname]l for utilizing these services. Thanks for sharing your thoughts."
Student41	Student81	1	"The idea of tele-mentoring seems to be moving along more slowly than it should. There are still the medical applications (http://phys.org/news/2015-08-surgeons-remote-telementoring.html) that I've heard about for so long, but any procedurally-based task seems like a poten[firstname]l candidate. Could a disabled Humvee in the field be scanned by a mechanic back at the FOB for repair work? I've always thought that the best and brightest people in their fields are bound by geographic constraints that technology could overcome. I think your research into this matter should be invaluable to the military and I wish you the best of luck with whatever research you undertake."	8/25/2015 20:25	783	6	Thanks for the feedback. \You are right about the advancement in technology moving at a glacier speed. this technology has been around for over a decade. I really do not understand the hesitation to adopt it. Maybe we need to put it in the soldiers hands and allow them to also communicate with friends back home.
Student37	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	2	Great Job! I really got a sense of where you are coming from and what you are trying to do. Hope you can get your ideas ironed out!	8/25/2015 20:05	16

Student91	Student7	1	"Hello Ben, despite the long time I am in the programming and software development field, I never had the opportunity lo learn to develop for a Mac or an Apple's device, I understand it is a simpler and nicer environment for great Machines/Devices and for an increasing [firstname]et. It is precisely the dominance on the [firstname]et of PCs that forced me to not moving from there, and perhaps learning to develop for iOS is a next step to me. I guess, as an experienced programmer, it will be easier for me to answer the question ""Where do I start?"", but having a comprehensive technology that will guide you and show you all the required elements/steps will be much faster. So I wish you a good luck with your project."	8/25/2015 20:39	2750		
Student91	Student58	1	"Hi [firstname]. I realize the GT OMSCS program is accepting many students with a degree in mathematics. I feel that students with strong mathematical abilities usually go deeper on these courses and on its projects. That is how i understand your interest in topics like Computer Vision, Natural language, and interaction with people. I am also fun of all these subjects, but I also think we need to set the scope of our projects to achieve something effective and doable in one semester period. Good luck with the choosing of your project/research subject."	8/25/2015 21:25	2680	5	
Student91	Student12	1	"Hello [firstname], I would like to emphasize the fact that you also would like to learn how educational technology compliments traditional teaching methods along with issues of impairments and disabilities. I believe most of us feel, in many ways, like disable when facing all the challenges and opportunities we would like to achieve, for example when we try to learn a new language, or master a complex math subject, or solve a complex math problem, specially with the time and other constraints we face in these endeavors. So I am, like most of us, very motivated to explore all these Educational Technology subjects, and to work in solving some of them.

I think technology will make great strides in reducing the education accessibility gap between the rich and poor. I taught co[lastname]g to high school students last summer, ranging from very rich to very poor and I was kind of shocked one day when one of the students told me she might have to leave the program because she couldn't afford the subway pass.

Student92	Student71	2	"Hey [firstname], it was a pleasure rea[lastname]g your personal statement. I congratulate you on your mentoring efforts. I absolutely agree that there is nothing like facetime in education. I left software engineering for a little while, and came back to it, but I wish I didn't lose those years. I think I could have really benefited from having a mentor. I hope that you find an interesting project in mentorship. I myself have always wished for a some sort of social network purely for reaching out the brighter or more established engineers to provide me some guidance."	8/26/2015 1:06	382		
Student92	Student36	2	Good to read your personal statement. I'm super impressed that you're finishing the MS program so quickly. Looking forward to seeing what you build this semester.	8/26/2015 1:13	890	6	
Student45	Student50	1	"I am glad to see that you are so enthusiastic about all the cool projects and ideas being shared in this class. I feel the same way, there is so much this class is offering. I totally second you on the fact that education should be available to any person at any time. I feel OMSCS is the first step towards that."	8/26/2015 9:42	636		
Student45	Student51	1	I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your story a lot. Its amazing to see how technology can have such a big impact on the lives of few individuals. Its great to know that you have a chance to fulfill one of your personal goals as well while taking this class. It is so exciting and a very positive feeling to be among so many passionate people. Its this passion which drives a person towards success.	8/26/2015 9:53	1978

Student15	Student82	1	"There are several efforts in the field of education on applying AI, guided learning & other types of adaptive engineering, it might be worth researching existing schemes to see how one of the existing methods can be improved to achieve your objectives. Overall, I felt the concept & approach was adequate. Good luck."	8/26/2015 14:14	159	5	I'm sure there will be plenty of research this semester. Thanks! Good luck to you to!
Student15	Student2	1	"Quite the honest approach on poten[firstname]l topics of interest and a great introduction. I like the comment on why only a subset of population is able to leverage the available technology tools, the uber question of how to engage. Good luck!"	8/26/2015 14:16	153		
Student15	Student30	1	Looks like you have all the educational and technical background to do some interesting projects. The approach seems practical and all the observations about evolution on education & technology were on point.	8/26/2015 14:19	115	5	"Thank you for the feedback, Rav. I agree that the Wiki idea has some merit and is my tentative choice for a class project."
Student15	Student79	1	"I like the simple intro and an inquisitive comments on how the current offerings does not create a large enough impact, even for the technology obsessed young minds. Would be interesting to see how you intend to compare the existing offerings or methods/ways to improve for better engagement."	8/26/2015 14:21	143		
Student97	Student77	1	"Very interesting story, your journey into CS through online education. I agree with the future of mobile education, people are gaining more engaged with mobile than their traditional desktop/laptop computer."	8/26/2015 15:19	230		
Student97	Student7	1	Great writing Ben. Playgrounds or sandbox for teaching computer science subject is indeed interesting. It can cut down setup time required and anyone can jump right into the sandbox to practice.	8/26/2015 15:23	437

Student97	Student49	1	"Very good writing, i enjoyed rea[lastname]g it. I also have the same interest in developing online platform for educating some topic in computer science. Virtualized environment as playground is indeed helpful for focusing student on learning rather than spent time on setting up environment. All the best"	8/26/2015 20:21	1412		
Student17	Student75	1	"I vastly agree with your point in that education technology has allowed us to live a much more flexible lifestyle. Having the option of learning in class or at home allows us in the OMSCS program to work while pursuing our degree as well, as opposed to a dedicated MS program where students may not have the option of working concurrently. Especially in the field of Computer Science, I believe that gaining professional experience is invaluable. I also think that your proposed project has lots of poten[firstname]l. It seems to be a tool that we do not currently have in the OMSCS program."	8/26/2015 16:03	473	6	"Thanks [firstname] for your time and feedback with interesting re[firstname]s. Yes, the number of students is increasing on every semester and in one point, the time ticket management could be very difficult when you will have lots of student with lots of preferences of the courses."
Student17	Student4	1	"Hi [firstname]! I also recently started using hackerrank, although I haven't had too much time to explore it. I think that the issues that you had pointed out with Computer Science programs are unfortunately common at many universities. Although they go over lots of theory, many don't prepare students for actual real-world co[lastname]g. I'm glad to hear that you were able to introduce new tools to your teachings. It's also re[firstname]able that companies such as Amazon, HP, and Toshiba came to recruit your students! I also agree that introducing new tools to enrich the practical learning experience of students is extremely beneficial. I believe that there is a lot of opportunity for tools used by teachers and professors to enrich the learning experience of students."	8/26/2015 16:11	1051	7	
Student17	Student33	1	"Hi [firstname], nice to meet you! I am also on the Interactive Intelligence track. It's very interesting to examine software programming tools such as Scratch and Tinker, which I think introducing to children at a young age may have a huge impact on their engineering capabilities in the future. Giving your kids such a head start is impressive! Of course most parents want their children to have the foundation for a promising outlook, but many don't know where to start. It will be interesting to see where your children end up in the future!"	8/26/2015 16:29	252	7	Thank you very much for the positive feedback.. Hopefully this will help them along the way.
Student17	Student8	1	"Hi Chris, nice to meet you! I am impressed by you and your family's background in special education, as it is a most admirable field. I can see your optimism and passion for the field and its studies. I hope that this class helps you in your endeavors to continue to technologically advance the field of special education."	8/26/2015 16:33	222		
Student96	Student30	1	"Hi Ned, It was really nice to read through personal introduction, and welcome to OMSCS. I think you'll find the courses are great and your background in IT will both be beneficial and will probably grow. I've also run a small web design company and learned something useful in every class so far (this is my 5th). Your ideas look very good. I'm curious what you come up with. The tutoring is very cool too. I can't imagine how you have so much time, but it seems like a perfect fit to combine IT background with experience with personalized tutoring. I also think the Wiki idea is good...buil[lastname]g tools to make this class run better seems like an awesome fit since we can eat our own dogfood. -[firstname]"	8/26/2015 16:16	341	7	"Hi [firstname], thank you for the feedback and encouragement - inclu[lastname]g Prof. Joyner, you are the 4th person to validate the idea of buil[lastname]g out the Wiki. I have a personal interest in assessing the state of technology, the [firstname]et and trends. All very interesting stuff... ;)"
Student96	Student67	1	"Hi [firstname], It was a pleasure to read your personal introduction. That's great how much you have done in OMSCS and Coursera and Edx so far. It's also curious to hear about trying to being an expert and find good educational opportunities online. From my perspective, we are spoiled by choice and lack a structure or personalized attention to grow. My wife is a coach and works hard to take skilled amateurs to professional athlete/performers. She fills a critical role as a guide to help people get through a complicated process. We're so ""DIY"" these days with everything available online, but she amazes me by knowing what students will go through and when. For example, on the second day she has them write themselves a letter remin[lastname]g why they are in the program. Then around 4 months in, there is a week where people start crying and she has them dig out their letters. I especially love the idea of bringing education to remote locations across the globe. That seems like an awesome way to reduce strife and lift people up from poverty. Anyway, have a great course and I look forward to rea[lastname]g about what you work on. -[firstname]"	8/26/2015 16:22	405	6	
Student96	Student15	1	"Hi [firstname], That seems like a very interesting idea to build the content tagging system. Curiously, I remember hearing similar ideas from 20 years ago when multimedia was king and HTML was just starting out. Ex: Uniform Resource Locations and stuff like that. It seems like such a quaint concept now that we have YouTube and such rich media. I'm curious to hear more about how you would address the stale OMSCS presentation content. My first impression was that it was an unfair assessment, but then I realized that I have trouble with the lectures too. My mind wanders too much. I started downloa[lastname]g the [lastname]scripts and editing them down to concise notes. Though I'm also very project based and get most of my learning through working on projects and interacting with other students working on the same thing. Anyway, have a great semester and I look forward to seeing what you create. [firstname] -[firstname]"	8/26/2015 16:28	369		
Student96	Student2	1	"Hi [firstname], I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal statement. The love of computer programming and desire to go back to school resonates with me. I'm personally a very self-paced learner and busy so going back to any other program would be difficult. I hope that you are able to apply the new degree to a new career that you love. I'll watch Sabas[firstname]n Thrun's video after your recommendation. Also, it's curious to see what you said about team-based learning. I've struggled with that in other OMSCS classes. One group was awesome and I loved working with them. It enhanced my experience. Another group was painful. I did learn things but felt that it involved too many late nights zoning out as team-members wrote papers by committee. It didn't help that we were 3 time zones apart and the team wanted to meet for hours per day. I think your comment about Udacity and Microsoft leads right to a question of hiring process. It seems that there are obstructions that make it harder for people with ""non-traditional"" education to even get a foot in the door. Second, once they get in the door, the cards are probably stacked against them. Though this totally depends on the [firstname]et and I don't know much about Microsoft's hiring process. On the other hand, I would bet this is playing into the ""Startup"" [firstname]et as people learn on their own and start buil[lastname]g products and companies without hurdles to jump. -[firstname]"	8/26/2015 16:35	1194

You're an administrator and teacher who wants to use data mining to improve the application of technology to education. =========== As usual, a very verbose write up. I'm reminded of Strunk and White's recommendation, ""Omit needless words"". What material would you remove from this assignment to help the reader focus on the points you really want to make? Does the preliminary outline of research belong in the personal statement? I think you could get by with a summary of your fin[lastname]gs. As it stands, I had trouble parsing the specific ""problem you are interested in"" through all the references and serial commas lists. Your enthusiasm is clear, as is your focus on data science. My interpretation of your personal statement is that you do a lot of administration, and, after that, teaching. It appears you would like to enhance your situational awareness of your students via data mining. I appreciate your notion of the UCI machine learning archive and your plan to use R and Scala. This will likely aid in group organization."	8/26/2015 17:22	582

You're a home-schooled technologist who wants to relieve some of the burden on teachers by buil[lastname]g tools to help teachers select rea[lastname]g material. =========== Did your homeschooling involve a larger than usual technological component? (eg online classes in subjects your home instructors were not expert, or ways to keep you engaged while also accomplishing other needful tasks?) There are many home school students out there. Could you turn your bias into a way to aid home schoolers? You imply that a strong AI teaching system would be a magic bullet to teaching challenges. How is this so? What do you imagine a strong AI teacher would do? Are there components of that which could be put into place now? Would it be possible to build a teacher's aide which interacted with students directly to aid the teacher in selecting rea[lastname]g material? Perhaps an ereader assistant could give suggestions, and keep the teacher in the loop. Some ereaders keep vocabulary lists based on words the reader looks up. Hooking into this might be a straightfoward way to approach rea[lastname]g lists."	8/26/2015 17:32	81	6

You're a research developer with experience a variety of online learning systems who wants to build tools to teach AIs. =========== Do you imagine humans taking classes alongside software agents? For example, Dr Joyner tracked the performance of agents as a collection. Perhaps if humans also took the test, their performance could be compared. We had some ad-hoc discussion of this in the papers and on piazza, but no concrete statistics. How would you apply this outside of RPMs? One of the goals of KBAI is to model human cognition in order to better understand human cogition. Would that be your end goal in creating an intelligent tutor for an agent, or is you goal strictly related to agent performance? This relates to one of my poten[firstname]l projects for this semester. Since I am taking [lastname]forcement learning, as well, I am considering an API which would allow humans agents to play the same games (cooperative dilemmas)."	8/26/2015 17:33	50

Good luck in this class! = D"	8/26/2015 20:02	291	6	
Student5	Student53	1	"Hi [firstname], I too had similar thinking around new systems adoption. I personally very rarely read any manuals, tutorials, or watch help videos. I too believe a system should be intuitive itself but sometimes there are indeed things system designers would want power users to use such as Gmail shortcuts (That I never know or use, but would be a great plus). I think a guided interactive kind of design would work best. In the Gmail example, probably ad[lastname]g shortcuts next to each main button (Send, compose, inbox, etc). That would help users like me better memorize these hidden features."	8/26/2015 20:07	513

I'm interested in teaching kids about computer science but I haven't been able to specifically find how. I believe that your first idea (a secure test submission tool), can still be valuable even outside of Udacity and the OMSCS. There is definitely an anxiety factor whenever you submit a programming assignment and not being sure about it. This might not be completely related, but Google Code Jam, uses a system of automatic gra[lastname]g: https://code.google.com/codejam. The system will generate different test input every time so your program can be run against a lot of different scena[lastname]."	8/29/2015 10:06	687		
Student64	Student49	2	"[firstname], you have quite the experience. As an AT&T employee, I found myself doubly interested in your statement because it taught me about an organization in the company that I was not very familiar with, but definitely would not mind [lastname]sitioning to there some day. Your idea sounds great, and I look forward to seeing what you are able to come up with this semester."	8/29/2015 11:15	329		
Student64	Student54	2	"Jon, your statement was very well structured and answered all of the questions accor[lastname]gly. I would like to hear more about the results of the tool you launched (congrats by the way!) and that is something that could be distributed to many educational institutions once developed further."	8/29/2015 11:23	465		
Student64	Student14	1	"[firstname], you have some very good and industry expan[lastname]g ideas listed here. I suggest choosing a specific topic as soon as possible so that you are able to get the most out of it. I look forward to seeing what you come up with this semester!"	8/29/2015 11:31	405		
Student64	jvang7@gatech.edu	1	Interesting background. The educational technology behind technology is a great idea. Maybe you could leverage some of your own experiences with having to learn so many different technologies to come up with a project idea.	8/29/2015 11:44	475		
Student25	Student99	1	"Hey [firstname], This is my third class too! Looks like it will be a fun research project to investigate the current state of EdTech with OMSCS and future solutions to help make it better. When you mention looking into technology solutions for the �underprivileged� are you talking about students living in poverty in K-12 education, higher education, or just anyone interested in learning more about a topic? Technology can be a great tool for sure but it also depends on reliable internet connection. I met a professor at the University I work at, and he went to Africa every year to teach computer science classes in some of the villages with no Internet and running power off of car batteries. They had to drive to town every day to get on the internet! Buil[lastname]g solutions that work offline are something to consider in these types of solutions too. Good luck!"	8/29/2015 11:44	1198		
Student25	Student90	1	"Hey [firstname], Looks like you really have a great relevant problem that you could certainly explore for this class. I have one child, and like you would do anything in the world to help them succeed. I can imagine you spen[lastname]g a lot of time and research into making EdTech better for children and understand the challenges that online learning faces with a multi-device universe we live in and how do you overcome the different incompatibilities devices, operating systems, and browsers designers have to look at. I see this all the time and is frustrating to students when they spend more time trying to figure out what browser combination they need to use to complete assignments. The Chrome problem you encountered brings up the discussion of is it up to the designers to always stay up to date on current popular browsers. Browsers will constantly be updated which can make it frustrating for programmers and the students using it. Sounds like you are passionate about this topic and using relevant events in your life will always make it an intriguing and interesting project to explore! And your results could even help your daughter with Math and benefit the EdTech community. Good luck and just awesome to see how much you care about your kids� education!"	8/29/2015 12:04	1234	7	
Student25	Student83	1	"Hey Mike, It was great rea[lastname]g about some of the challenges these courses have on the gra[lastname]g side and sounds like it certainly be improved. Gaining efficiency in these areas that would hopefully increase the number of students. It seems like most courses have student enrollment limits based on the number of TAs. Making their jobs easier helps them assign more students per TA. Your topic takes on the other half of these types of learning environments which focuses on the technology behind gra[lastname]g/assessing students work. Researching topics that make your job as a TA is a worthwhile endeavor and would be a great contribution to the EdTech community. Good luck!"	8/29/2015 12:25	3799		
Student25	Student11	1	"Hey Vu, I share the same thoughts about Blackboard :) I think investigating solutions on improving access to professionals that want to sharpen their skills would be pretty cool. Keeping students interested or engaged can come at so many different angles such as the Psychology of the end user. Do you have an interest in health care systems? Might be worth taking on the role of technology with healthcare education. Can OMS be applied to those types of studies? Just some ideas to explore if you are still looking for topics. Good luck!"	8/29/2015 13:28	854		
Student3	Student60	2	"As someone who is obviously interested in the combination of Cognitive Science and Computer Science, Problem #2 would be an interesting challenge. For this Ed Tech class, a simple survey was distributed to match students to mentors. The same type of cognitive assessment could be utilized here. I would be interested to see what types of research / movement has already been made in this field. Fantastic idea!"	8/29/2015 12:19	1324	7	Thanks. This was inspiring.
Student3	Student38	1	"For the courses you have taken already (specifically ones that may have had mid-term / final exams), did you find yourself in or observe a situation where you could have taken advantage of the situation unfairly? Since its inception GT's OMSCS has expressed incredible interest in receiving direct feedback from its students. Since this course aims to actually ""solve"" a problem and not just ""research"" one, this could be an incredible opportunity to give back and improve a program that you already have stake in. Good luck!"	8/29/2015 12:42	407	6	Provides a pretty good question to consider regar[lastname]g giving feedback to the institution about flaws in the system.
Student3	Student26	1	"Your objective in this course is clear: to gain something more than a letter grade and general computing theory - something tangible. This is actually the point of a Masters Program that other OMSCS courses do not accomplish in my opinion. I am equally excited about this semester with you. I am certain other students in this class are looking to improve online education in some manner. Although it is rewar[lastname]g to create ""nothing-from-something"", I encourage you to utilize our classmates ideas and build something feasible. Best of luck!"	8/29/2015 12:49	430	6	I appreciated this feedback.
Student3	Student65	1	"I apologize, due to the length of your submission, I skimmed directly to the problems you are considering. Please try and stay within the suggested word limit of the assignments. As an IT Director at a one-to-one school and a K-12 IT consultant in my free time, I can sympathize with your struggle on implementing technology into the classroom. I specifically consult with schools because of the amount of failed mobile device ini[firstname]tives I have seen. This failure occurs for a variety of reasons but it usually fits into one of three categories: Administrative Buy-In, Teacher PD and Quality IT Support. All 3 are critical. You fall into the second and I the third. You cannot accomplish your day-to-day tasks if the technology is not working due to folks like me. I do not sit back in the ""server room"" and monitor. I visit and observe classroom technology in action during class time to better assist teachers in their objectives. I need more teachers like you. My only suggestion is to never settle for any standard product or practice. Always try to improve your technology instruction; get creative and collaborate with your other tech-savvy teachers or even IT managers. Although some schools may think they are doing everything correctly, if you scratch beneath the surface you will discover the numerous pitfalls. A true technology school is difficult to find even though most schools preach that they are all ""Preparing students for the 21st century."" We have to be the ones that define technology best practices for our environment. There is too much technology available to box ourselves into only a few products. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor to improve your classroom. Sorry if I don't have any specific advice for you. Thanks for rea[lastname]g."	8/29/2015 12:56	1149	7	
Student63	Student98	1	"Hi Student98, congratulations on your internship. I think this course is a great start to prepare the teaching material in the university."	8/29/2015 12:37	520	6	Thank you for the feedback.
Student63	Student52	1	It is impressive that author can speak more than two languages. I believe author can contribute to the this community by using author's experience in educational technology.	8/29/2015 12:46	2093	6	
Student63	Misc3	1	Author has an interesting proposal about developing a intelligent training system. I also have same kind of trouble in training new people on the equipment. An intelligent training system might be a solution for reducing training time and increasing the possibility of successful training.	8/29/2015 13:21	577		
Student63	Student28	1	Author has an interesting proposal about the subconscious learning. It reminds me the concept of educational game. I think it would be a great project for this course.	8/29/2015 13:31	647		
Student70	Student63	1	"Hi Yi-Chen, nice to meet you! I can definitely see your enthusiasm for this class, which is great. Also your background is impressive and I am pretty sure you will be able to contribute to this class a lot. Your idea of the smart agent that can learn, teach and provide feedback is amazing. Good luck with the project!"	8/29/2015 12:42	387		
Student70	Student60	1	"Hi Saurav and nice to meet you! I can definitely see your passion and interest for this class, I am pretty sure you will be able to contribute a lot to it. I think your idea to create an agent that can classify personalities is great, and I am pretty sure will be a big challenge, but the goal is the most important part. I also believe that most of the OMSCS students are like isolated islands with very little or none interaction to each other at all. Good luck with your project!"	8/29/2015 12:49	510	7	Thanks for the feedback. The feedback was inspiring.
Student70	Student55	1	"I think your passion for education and technology is clear, also your ability to step back and understand the overall picture is something not all people has. I am pretty sure you will definitely contribute a lot to this class. Good luck with your project!"	8/29/2015 12:58	532		
Student70	Student43	0	"Hi [firstname] and nice to meet you! I can definitely see your interest for this class, trying to give back a little bit of what technology had helped during your education. I think I like your idea of the agent capable of learn and maybe also teach either persons or other agents. Good luck with your project!"	8/29/2015 13:06	490	5	
Student66	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	I think it's outstan[lastname]g how much community outreach you are involved with and it sounds like you'll be able to take much of what you do in this class and apply it to helping people around the world. I also think using an intelligent agent to measure if the student was understan[lastname]g the material is a really cool idea. What sort of metrics would you use to measure understan[lastname]g? Would it be something that automatically generated quizzes or something similar? Best of luck on your project!	8/29/2015 13:31	399		
Student66	Student37	1	"It's very nice to meet you [firstname]. I definitely agree that learning is hardly limited to the classroom. As you enter more and more leadership roles (particularly technical leadership), the way in which you help others to understand new concepts becomes absolutely critical to keeping everyone on the same page. Recently, at the beginning of the summer, we spoke about creating some seminars to help our new interns to understand the product and technology at play. Unfortunately, we realized that it would take a lot of time to prepare the necessary slides so we decided to go with a more hands-on approach. That also ties into your other point which is that we couldn't think of a good way to present content other than just through some glorified PowerPoints. I think you've got a great topic and I wish you the best of luck with your project!"	8/29/2015 13:48	496		
Student66	Student1	1	"It's nice to meet you Sam. Very cool on the history part, I am a bit of a history buff myself (been learning about the Roman Republic time period lately). I am planning to pursue the game-based learning topic myself and I have to admit I have seen many express the opinion that creating games for content-based subjects such as history is much more difficult than creating them for algorithm-based subjects such as mathematics. That said, I think your passion for history will help you make a great contribution in this field and I look forward to seeing what you come up with. If you are interested in starting a group, please feel free to reach out."	8/29/2015 13:56	529	7	
Student66	Student86	2	"Hello [firstname]! I was an electrical engineer myself but fell in love with software so I started to make the [lastname]sition over as well. You make a very good (and well-researched) argument regar[lastname]g ad[lastname]g computer programming to the list of core subjects. I've always thought that, with the power of such incredibly powerful processors at our fingertips, that it was silly that most people in the world only know how to go to websites and open glorified word processors. As you say, I think that we are guilty of putting computer programming on a pedestal, believing it to be just for really smart people when in fact it is a highly attainable skill for many if they give it a fair shot. Best of luck on your project!"	8/29/2015 14:11	1084		
Student50	Student1	2	"Wow - you seem to have refined your area of interest quite well already - it's impressive to see that you've already settled on a concrete metric for success! It sounds like you have a background educating in diverse formats, so I imagine you'll have some unique perspectives to bring to the table. I'd never heard of Desire2Learn before - do you think creating a solution that could integrate with that platform would be viable? Doing so might be a great way to field test your design and get some nice analytics. Speaking of your design - intelligent tutoring sounds great! Do you think such a tutoring system would run into problems with scaling and ""fair"" distribution of content? What other practical issues might be unique to that approach?"	8/29/2015 13:46	587	7	
Student50	Student51	1	"Hey, [firstname]! This is great - you've got such a wealth of personal experiences to draw educational inspiration from. I imagine that homeschooling four children makes taking a break from dissecting and discussing education near-impossible! That's got to be a challenging (and rewar[lastname]g) pursuit. I was previously-unfamiliar with the concept of video modeling, but some brief investigation has piqued my interest. If that technique does tend to resonate well with autistic individuals, I imagine that there's poten[firstname]l for adapting that concept to an infinitely-wide variety of spaces and tasks. Is there a particular goal or problem you'd aim to address by delving into video modeling? Or would you be more interested in looking at the higher-level impact of the strategy? In any case - that sounds like a really interesting field, and I'd be curious about your results! Best of luck this term!"	8/29/2015 13:56	1129		
Student50	Student76	2	"Hey, [firstname] - what an interesting background - it sounds like you've had some quite-varied educational experiences! Out of cu[lastname]ity, do you think these experiences will influence how you approach the education of your own children? I love the multi-domain explorations and designs I've seen pop up in this course so far, and yours is no exception. The sensor, NLP, and content aspects of your project would each be a significant undertakings in its own right - do you think the complete design could be achieved within the duration of this semester? Or would you start with a more basic solution, ultimately laying in-roads for future designs? In any case, great personal statement! This is bound to be an exciting semester. :)"	8/29/2015 14:15	874		
Student50	Student66	1	"Hey, Tim - It's fortunate that you're interested in both adaptive tutoring and game-based learning, as they do have the poten[firstname]l to nicely feed into each other! Games are a great platform to deliver intelligently-tailored content in an organic, somewhat-opaque way. Do you think you'd be interesting in creating a small game as a platform to test out your proposed system? Or are you perhaps leaning towards working on a more general solution? In any case, connecting ML to education seems like it'd open up a whole slew of interesting poten[firstname]l design projects, and it's going to be a great place to start! Enjoy the term!"	8/29/2015 14:30	557		
Student21	Student90	1	"Hi [firstname], My ini[firstname]l goal was also to create a software that will motivate kids to learn. Ad[lastname]g music therapy sounds very interesting. Few years ago I read about a research on how classical music helps kids to focus. All the best with the project."	8/29/2015 14:08	427	5	
Student21	Student25	1	Your idea will be very useful to high school students. I remember taking classes in virtual classrooms at work where we were given an environment pre-loaded with software. This enabled the entire class to move at the same speed and focus on class material instead of debugging issues related to the setup.	8/29/2015 14:16	621	6	
Student21	Student19	1	I can see your passion for computer science. Looking forward to see your final product - research paper or design.	8/29/2015 14:26	6901	5	
Student21	Student9	1	Wow. I did not know anything about these games until I read your assignment. Teaching system level thinking using games is an innovative idea. I make my kids watch or hear news everyday to know what is going on in the world. Teaching these skills at an early age will create a smarter generation of kids.	8/29/2015 16:26	1742		
Student30	Student39	2	"Hi [firstname]y, It was good to read your personal statement - I liked the story of how technology has [lastname]ed since your time in HS - I too am amazed at the tremendous rate of [lastname]e/adoption of new technologies, the promise they hold to improve education and excite students. I like too your clear passion for ed tech and sense of humor - 'non-android teacher...' ;) I share your passion for buil[lastname]g better mobile/cloud delivery systems and interactive apps. The limit for this is only our bounded by our own imaginations... Good luck and I look forward to seeing what you come up with, Ned"	8/29/2015 17:53	563		
Student30	Student79	1	"Hello unnamed person... ;) I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal statement and love to see teachers passionately involved with ed tech and applying in their classrooms, at work, and with their children at home. I agree that ed tech in and of itself is not a panacea - and that simply putting iPads in every student's hands is not enough - and that while ed tech is enabling, and holds the promise of training and inspiring better students, it is no substitute for great teachers. One interesting thought is that both teachers and students are learning together (through rapid adoption and experimentation) what works and what does not. I think we are in for very interesting [lastname]es - for the better - and that this [lastname]e will happen rapidly - perhaps frequently disruptively. We shall see."	8/29/2015 18:03	485		
Student30	Student82	2	"Hi [firstname], It was good rea[lastname]g your personal statement - I appreciate you sharing your background and observations about education and the various challenges of programs like OMSCS. Your observation about be availability of qualified TAs being the primary limiting factor on growing the OMSCS programs matches the consensus view I am seeing as a first semester OMSCS student. And your (par[firstname]l) solution of an AI TA for gra[lastname]g AI papers is of course brilliant - and an idea that many others have floated in one form or another. I encourage your efforts along these lines and imagine that you could partner with others to fulfill this sort of project, or at least get a working demo/prototype off ready for feedback. Well done and good luck, and let me know if I can help in any way, Ned"	8/29/2015 18:11	656	6	"Thanks Ned! If you're looking to join a project, I'm willing to work with others. There's a few ways the auto-grader can be extended, that I won't be able to get to myself, such as verifying the identity of the author and detecting plagiarism."
Student30	Student78	2	"Hi [firstname], I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal statement - especially what you shared about your family and personal life, and your professional life and career, as well as information that I found helpful re; OMSCS classes - I am a first-semester student, so thank you for sharing your experience, and I appreciate that the overwhelming majority of OMSCS students appear to be working, experienced IT professionals interested in not only continuing their education but with a passion for new projects. I'm interested in learning more about your experiences with the Interactive Intelligence specialization - and my thought on your observation that this class may focus primarily on 'intelligent tech' is that for money, at least, the mission or charter of the class is more broad-based (at least mine is, anyway) - with a poten[firstname]l focus on the entire range of enabling ed tech - and not just in the classroom or industry-based training, but in the consumer areas too. For this reason, I'm considering making my contribution to survey or assess the entire scope of ed tech in the widest sense of the work and possibly incorporate this content to the existing course Wiki - having a strong survey of what is out there, where it is being used, and trends seems foundational to me. I agree that online tutoring systems can be great - have you seen Codecademy.com - especially the Intro to Python interactive course - this is one of the better interactive tutorials I have seen... ;) Good luck and let me know if I can help, Ned"	8/29/2015 18:22	663		
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student35	1	It sounds like your background with tools like Sakai might have given you some pre-existing experience with information retrieval. I've read a few papers in that area in the past but I'm definitely up to date on it at this point. Hopefully I'll have a chance to read the paper you write and/or look at the project you create later in the semester. Good luck!	8/29/2015 20:13	2549		
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student92	1	"Since you brought up assessment (i.e. one correctly answered question on Codecademy doesn't demonstrate mastery), if that's an area you're interested in, I would suggest maybe focusing your research in the intelligent tutor area. Along those lines, a pretty cool cognitive model that might interest you is Ken Koe[lastname]ger's Learning Factor Analysis (LFA). He's the PI of the lab I was in at CMU so I've seen first-hand how well it can work (at least in my opinion). Good luck this semester!"	8/29/2015 21:01	918		
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student42	1	"I can definitely relate to your background. I worked for several years at US Steel. Some of what I developed I still think is really cool, but I also had to do a lot of line of business applications that eventually began to fail to excite the senses. Hopefully doing some research in an area that it seems like you care about will help reignite that for you!"	8/29/2015 21:17	473		
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student13	2	"Hey Nate! (This is Misc2 btw, not sure if Peer Feedback lets you see my full name). This is definitely the most thorough introduction I've read so far, although I would expect nothing less from you. :) I was going to suggest a paper for you, but I checked your references section first just in case and, sure enough, it was already there -- A machine learning approach for automatic student model discovery. (Koe[lastname]ger and Matsuda are in my former lab at CMU.) Speaking of that paper though, it makes the occasional reference to Learning Factor Analysis (LFA), which you might find interesting on the learning assessment side of things. It's a cognitive model based on Knowledge Components, i.e an object representing an individual or composite piece of knowledge (ex. you need to know what a line is in order to know what a parallel line is, etc). It gives a semi-automated way to assess a student's performance on the KCs in a particular subject. I'm not sure if that will necessarily assist you on the individual research you've chosen for the semester, but it might be interesting to look at in the context of EDM in general. But anyway, best of luck this semester!"	8/29/2015 21:26	2276		
Student47	Student10	1	"Hi, [firstname]! I think this is a really cool topic and you sound very passionate about it and it's great you have a lot of ideas already flowing. Language requires such an individualized instruction and so using EdTech to solve this dilemma is very appropriate. Have you used any of the language learning apps like duolingo or rosetta stone? I also like your voice recognition idea, it could also be used for speech therapy. As you said, this is a lot to cover in one semester so focusing on one language - in your case, Mandarin - is a good approach."	8/29/2015 22:35	1324		
Student47	Student17	1	"Hi [firstname]! This is a fascinating topic. I would have liked to hear about some specific examples of using modern technologies in the classroom. Is it possible to overuse technology in the classroom, and what impact does that have on learning? I see that you touched on schools with lower fun[lastname]g outperforming bigger budget schools. I think technology is still very expensive and school administrators have a hard time justifying the cost of technology. As you think about your project and your startup, how do you overcome that?"	8/29/2015 22:57	1085	7	This is an absolutely valid point. I would need to make the implemented technology a cost-effective and viable option in order to justify the cost.
Student47	Student4	1	"Hi [firstname]! Your story about turning around the class is phenomenal. Congratulations and I wish it continued success. It's interesting that you mention it was a class of 60 students, to me that sounds like a very large classroom. Would your project cater to larger or smaller classrooms, or does it not matter? As you suggested, real-time feedback is crucial to learning and being engaged. This frequent feedback (I think its called formative assessment) is very difficult to put into regular practice so developing a mechanism to do that I think is a great idea."	8/29/2015 23:15	1695		
Student47	Student33	1	"Hi [firstname]! That is great that you are getting your kids interested in programming and engineering at such a young age. The problem-solving, communication, and creativity skills that will come out of the experience is, as you said, very beneficial. Maybe they will be in OMSCS one day :). But in regards to your project, as someone also in the interactive intelligence tract, I look forward to rea[lastname]g your research."	8/29/2015 23:43	933	1	
Student13	Student71	2	"I thoroughly enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal summary [firstname]. Am excited to be in the same class as you (Nate [lastname] here), and excited to see what you accomplish! Fascinated to learn about your time at Kimberely-Clark. One of our Group Directors at Car[lastname]al Path used to work there, and I have heard all about their culture through his many experiences (Dan Crane). I did enjoy your comments on mentoring. I too have done a ton of mentoring and honestly been mentored by many. There is nothing like it. In terms of your specific focus on areas to explore, I love both of them. I am intrigued on your first one - how educational technology could be used to impart old technologies to new generations. My immediate question, honestly, was how pedagogically the teaching of old tech would or should differ from teaching new content. For example, what really is different from teaching COBOL vs Java 8? I mean, to a new learner, they are both new. Is the missing piece the application? Or, are there fundamental programming differences that must be approached in a different pedagogical way in order to make them stick. Would love to actually see what you find if you go that way. In terms of the second piece, I am curious about your paper exploring skill development for disadvantaged youth. As I put my educator hat on, I wonder. What exactly is it about disadvantaged youth that requires a pedagogical [lastname]e? What has been tried? In theory I would expect that the learning style profiles might be the same as with advantaged youth. Thus, it is access that is the issue technology wise? Others? Something else that would impact the education part of that discussion. Overall, I look forward to seeing what you come up with. Good luck and be sure to keep in touch!"	8/30/2015 0:21	452	7	"This feedback has me wondering if I'm on the right track with what we are doing (which is good, not bad...always need to be thinking). Specifically with the knowledge [lastname]sfer idea, I'm thinking the problem is one of lack of knowledge, not necessarily mode of [lastname]sfer. However, in instances where I simply have had to [lastname]sfer my knowledge during a job [lastname]e, not even counting the technological considerations but just those of process, the problems have been in provi[lastname]g a bunch of written documentation without an interface or visual example of how to do a particular task. Something to consider going forward."
Student13	Student35	1	"Hi [firstname]. I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your ini[firstname]l personal statement and look forward to keeping in touch through the course (Nate [lastname] here). I am intrigued about your years of experience managing academic and research software. I know we only had a short time to write. Still, I was curious and would have loved you to expand on this introduction and experiences. For example, you mentioned talking about working on Sakai. How has work on this platform [lastname]ed your view of the role that educational technology can play in the student experience? What would you improve? Remove? Are there any lessons that you want to share? Major concerns that you have? Honestly, would love to learn and read more from this piece. Furthermore, in terms of your contributions to open source (Fedora for example), how have your contributions [lastname]ed or impacted your view of the educational technology community? For example, how much open source work goes on in educational technology and why? Why is there so little (in my opinion). Are there reasons that institutions are slow to adopt open source frameworks (an argument I want to make. Finally, in terms of your REU work. What have your learned from this experience or others? In terms of the information retrieval work that you are interested in, I have a lot of questions here. What about the information retrieval work that you might be interested in can impact both technology designers and educators? Is it the task of information retrieval, or the analysis of the data that is retrieved that can be most fruitful from an insight perspective? I am going to be working hopefully in my PhD with researchers who work in information retrieval, and thus of course am very interested in both retrieval and analysis. That said, they each play different roles or solve different problems. Thanks again and good luck with everything. Keep in touch and good luck in the course!"	8/30/2015 0:29	541		
Student13	Student42	1	"Hi Nick! It was great to read your ini[firstname]l feedback. I look forward to taking the class together and hope that we can keep in touch (Nate [lastname] here). At the outset, I am fascinated by your experience doing software application development in the defense industry & data warehousing. I do a lot of work in that are, data warehousing, and would love to collaborate (look for me on Linke[lastname]: Student13, or e-mail: n[lastname]@car[lastname]alpath.com). Would be curious honestly how those experiences might impact your approach to this class and perception of software development for educational technology institutions. In terms of taking CS 6460, I love how you describe taking the class and your motivations taking the class / writing code as a means of solving problems versus writing code. I agree with you that there are major challenges in educational technology from a development perspective. I am there, though I still find myself in love with writing code - though perhaps that is because I haven't written enough of it :-). I also resonate with your involvement in education. My mom was a teacher and I spent a lot of time in that area. I was also the manager of graduate programs for the Faculty of Education at Simon Fraser University for a year; an experience, which truly opened my eyes to the realities of education. In terms of thinking about what you are interested in, I am curious how you will poten[firstname]lly approach things in this area. For example, I agree that increasing the availability of affordable educational technology could help close that gap. That said, assuming that you have limited resources, what technology would you start with first and why? Are there certain technologies that are most amenable to success for individuals with low access? Are there pedagogical challenges that need to be met that are not currently being met in these groups? What or how would you approach things here? The same kinds of thoughts relate to your point on the use of innovative electronic curriculum. What would you define as innovative electronic curriculum and why? What makes curriculum innovative? Is it the content? The delivery method? Is the medium really the message? Many questions deserved to be asked here. All in all, I really look forward to seeing what you come up with and wish you luck in the course. Be sure to keep in touch!"	8/30/2015 0:40	663		
Student13	Student92	1	"Hi [firstname]. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your ini[firstname]l personal statement. I am excited that you have found OMSCS a good fit based on your learning style, and look forward to seeing what you accomplish in the course and the program. I also look forward to keeping in touch. Feel free to find me on Linke[lastname] (Student13), or e-mail me: n[lastname]@car[lastname]alpath.com. In terms of your ini[firstname]l experience in college. I am curious how or whether educational technology could have helped that. For example, you talk about education being passive and unidirectional. When I hear that, I immediately think about educaitonal gaming and wonder if that is a good fit for this analogy. Now, I do agree that teachers can make a mistake by conveying things unilaterally. That said, I wonder if and how educational technology can specifically address things. When I think about what you are interested in, and your reference to gaming, I wonder about again some of the gaming links that I posted. Have you ever seen Co[lastname]Games? I will have to send you some other links if you are interested there? Also, your story about the student that was frustrated and who gave up really resonated with me. I have taught at the post secondary level for many years and that is the toughest situation - seeing students with great poten[firstname]l give up. I wonder if this will be the catalyst for any project you choose. For example, what tools would you have given to her to help her succeed? How do you know that the tools would help her or others like her succeed? Could you design a test to look for this? I think you should keep exploring this if you have the time! Good luck and keep in touch!"	8/30/2015 0:53	710		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student6	1	"[firstname], Apple Basic! I remember that. :) Good overview of your experience, and I know what you mean about corporate re-education. Lots of room for improvement there. I am glad to see you are interested in training new employees, and I can confirm the need for that. In fact, I suspect there are millions of dollars wasted every day due to inefficient onboar[lastname]g and inadequate new hire training. Good luck with the course."	8/30/2015 1:11	561	6	"This was helpful, as a lot of piazza talk is around educating kids. It is good to get [lastname]forcement that corporate education improvement is needed as well."
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student94	1	"Sounds like an interesting project. One of my children attended Montessori, and I am think it a wonderful methodology. It is a very ""hands on"" approach however, and I, too, wonder what place technology has in that environment. Good luck."	8/30/2015 1:20	306		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student72	1	"Hi [firstname]. Interesting topic for your project. In fact, I just reviewed another student who is interested in Montessori as well! One of my children participated in Montessori and I think it is a wonderful methodology. Since Montessori is so focused on ""hands-on"" education, I wonder if those experiences can be virtualized. Interesting questions, and good luck on your project."	8/30/2015 1:28	223		
mdarden6@gatech.edu	Student74	1	"[firstname], I think you have an interesting area for research. Mobile devices are [lastname]sforming all areas of life, and I think they are currently underutilized in education. There is great promise for special needs learners, so I am glad you thinking in this area. Good luck on your project."	8/30/2015 1:32	224		
Student56	Student60	2	"This was a nice, organized introduction. You especially 'exceeded expectations' by already provi[lastname]g though out project ideas! I think your ideas are interesting. Regar[lastname]g the group formation - don't you think that skill level is important to take into consideration in forming groups, perhaps even more than personality? Also, a successful group may not be about the same, but rather the right ba[firstname], of personalities and skill levels. Just a thought. Great paper!"	8/30/2015 2:02	185	7	Fresh ideas are really helpful. The feedback was helpful.
Student56	Student85	2	This was a thorough introduction and an enjoyable read as well! I'm trying to imagine a classroom of second graders ad[lastname]g apples on a computer screen. Give it a few more years... I wouldn't be surprised. I guess the way you view the teacher is at the 'control center' of all these individual little computers.	8/30/2015 2:06	283	6	"Regar[lastname]g ""I guess the way you view the teacher is at the 'control center' of all these individual little computers"", that's true, although I'd add that that I personally see the teacher's role in such a curriculum as more ""management by exception"" than ""control center"". Certainly the teacher would have an overall view of the students' progress and the ability to drill into the exact questions pupils are struggling with."
Student56	Student95	2	"Thorough introduction, and a pleasant read as well. I find your classroom experience interesting, and I'm sure it'll enhance your work in this class. In fact, I'm curious how many people taking this class are actually teachers. Perhaps I will put up a poll on piazza. Nice work!"	8/30/2015 2:11	117		
Student56	Student70	1	"Nice, thorough introduction. Your [lastname] analogy is interesting and makes a good point."	8/30/2015 2:13	83	5	
Student14	Student44	1	"[firstname], you have a really neat & eclectic background! Was even more interesting is your experience in EduTech - You could really make a meaningful impact in the course. I'm looking forward to seeing what business ideas develop while in the course! Do you have any interests, even in a general sense that you would like to explore?"	9/23/2015 23:27	150		
Student14	Student64	1	"[firstname], I think its neat that you come from a family of educators - puts you at a great advantage! Considering your resources (your family) for advice from experience - you seem to have an edge to contribute to the community! The question on children being taught life skills alongside of them grasping technology at a more rapid pace really strikes me. What would you consider essen[firstname]l life skills? I think that would differ from a generational perspective (Baby Boomers to Generation Y). Sounds like it would be really cool to explore!"	9/23/2015 23:30	963	6	
Student14	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	2	"[firstname], thanks for being so invested in education of children (one of my passions) and for sharing your background! Would you say that proving that ""technology is a tool for teachers, not a replacement"" would be something you would like to continue to explore in this course? It will be great to follow-up later to see what your working on! Congrats on all of your achievements!"	9/23/2015 23:49	235		
Student14	jvang7@gatech.edu	1	"Jensen, Do you have any examples of how this course might help you to ""broaden [your] knowledge and help [you] apply to real world challenges in [your] community in food and drought, especially that fact that [your] current job requirements lots of stakeholder involvement. I'm especially interested on how you would apply combine educational technology to the non-profits - would it be for training purposes? disaster preparation? Looking forward to seeing what you decide to focus on :)"	9/23/2015 23:53	281
