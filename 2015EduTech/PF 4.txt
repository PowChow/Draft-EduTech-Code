Student93	Student64	0	"I have to be honest that this mini-proposal did not meet my expectations. If anything it covered informations I would expected to see in the assignment 1 where the scope was to discuss what areas do interest you and how are you planning to contribute. Perhaps the fact that you switched the subject from modeling the student behavior played a role in this. In this case it is fine not to meet the expectations as it is very common for people to realize that they would rather pursue something else. I am curious however what made you switch the gears because the topic of modeling behavior is very intriguing . I myself am working on exactly that. Regar[lastname]g your new proposal to bridge the gap in education for lower income communities, it is very noble and I would look forward to see what you will come up with. However I have seen few people in this class propose similar ideas already. I would recommend teaming up with them and going back to your previous idea."	9/13/2015 11:51	415	6	"Student93, thank you for you honest feedback. It is very helpful and will aide me as I move forward! Hopefully I get to review your work at some point. I am interested to see what you are proposing along the lines of modeling student behavior."
Student93	Student10	1	"I love this idea of immersion through helping the student consume the content. I can see this being picked up by a lot of people inclu[lastname]g myself (however I do not have an immediate interest in the Mandarin language). In the past I have attempted to learn additional languages (I currently speak Russian, Bulgarian, English and Romanian) such as French and Spanish. My approach was to dive in my picking up the subject I love and studying it in that language. I have to admit I have got lost while trying to learn French in that way. Spanish on the other side was easier to stick with (par[firstname]lly because my spouse's native tongue is Spanish). So, your approach is very different, but it shares the same core --- immersion. The way you are planning to do also sounds very solid. Instead of overwhelming the student by [lastname]slation of the whole page, is is much more preferable to annotate only the necessary text. This begs the question though -- how are you updating the student vocabulary? Is this done by a student? Also, how are you introducing new content? Finally, is the goal in teaching the student a new language or provi[lastname]g a necessary environment where the student can practice the acquired skills so far?"	9/13/2015 11:59	788		
Student93	Student61	2	This is a very create elevator pitch and I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g it -- thus stating as it exceeded my expectations (especially based on what I have read thus far). You did an awesome job structuring your mini-proposal from beliefs to desires and estimations of what needs to be done. I could say that you are a very energetic and creative individual by the way your write. I would certainly like to see what is going to come out of it. The only thing that I have to say is that last page seems to be written in a rush -- it does not have the same style and feel. It rather reads like a draft and left me wanting to see more. Perhaps that the exact definition of the elevator pitch??	9/13/2015 12:12	695	5	"Yup, that was my intent of the last page and it IS a draft of what I will include in the final proposal and project!"
Student93	Student1	1	"Very clean style of writing! (I wish more student put their thoughts in the similar fashion). I do not know the answers to the four questions you have outlined above, but if there IS a disparity between online and in-seat completion rates I would hope there is a technology solution. I see the student's engagement to be one of the most important factors and so far [firstname] has done an unbelievable job in engaging them. So what is [firstname] doing differently? He had published couple of the interviews where he mentions that he can interact with the student at any time and at very different level. Perhaps that is the answer to technology question. If the class can be personalized toward student's skill level and social comfortless, then it is possible to influence the completion rates? I don't know...I haven't researched this area and I am not an educator myself, so I can only speculate. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 12:24	1455	7	
Student16	Student76	2	"Extremely well written. I liked the intro, explanation, even the goals (though I think they are a little aggressive for one term). Engagement detection is difficult, are there libraries and tools available for this, or do you have to roll your own?"	9/13/2015 11:59	195		
Student16	Student101	0	"This feels overly broad. There are so many different tools out there, many having such as simple UI that anyone who desires can self-teach (IMO). If this believe is true, you are targeting the lazy and incompetent, which would be futile. I suggest focusing on a particular tool or uptake in a particular technique. For instance, the use of real-time videoconferencing for student assignment support. Or the advantages of adaptive testing techniques in a common Learning Management System. For OSS LMSes, such as Moodle, there are hundreds of plugins. Is there one that has the poten[firstname]l to [lastname]e education but has very little use? Could you analyze why and find a way to address it?"	9/13/2015 12:02	275	7	
Student16	Student2	1	"Very interesting topic. I'm working on something similar, if you're interested in collaboration, email me at Student16 Regar[lastname]g your paper - there are quite a few flashcard and repetition-style apps currently available, though they mostly target the consumer rather than the content provider. Besides the admin interface and basic reporting, are there any benefits for the educator? What's the motivation for a learner to spend 30 seconds on their phone reviewing content when you're competing with 30 seconds of Angry Birds?"	9/13/2015 12:09	482		
Student16	Student42	1	"Your proposal is well written (be careful, some run-on sentences) and an interesting topic, but I have one big concern if you're considering implementation. Looking at this from the ""elevator pitch"" point of view, I think you have a big customer problem. Low income homes are those least likely to have computers, iPads, or other consumption devices. Those with poor educator are also least likely to value education, so less likely to purchase or use a program like this. I could see an argument for more breadth of language in children's TV programs, but not an educational application."	9/13/2015 12:17	359		
Student45	Student99	2	This was a Perfect Mini-proposal and covered everything in a succinct manner.	9/13/2015 12:04	745	7	
Student45	Student88	1	I like how you have clarity about what work needs to be done to achieve your goal.	9/13/2015 12:17	447		
Student45	Student41	1	"Interesting Project idea! I agree with you that why would a SME want to make themselves available to do this? I like Piazza because we don't have to wait for SME's or professor/TA's to answer all our questions, even students can answer questions which at times help shorten the response time wait. Hence we are reducing dependency on SME's"	9/13/2015 13:55	8		
Student45	Student65	1	"Great idea. Although I have no experience in teaching, but definitely feel this tool will make life easier for an instructor. With the wide variety of features, this could be a really good application. Good luck!"	9/16/2015 11:27	1548	6	
Misc3	Student10	1	"I really like your approach to helping students read a new language. Although the focus is Mandarin, the model could be applied to other languages. I've used the color technique to learn to read arabic and it was very helpful. To your point I was able to read smoothly through the words."	9/13/2015 13:28	239		
Misc3	Student93	1	"I can't speak much to the content, the topic is beyond me. But in regards to the assignment, you have a lot of detail which I think you can use for the final proposal, however, I think the assignment is to create an ""elevator pitch"" so the paper could be shorter and quickly present the problem-solution to someone who may not understand the full details."	9/13/2015 13:32	254	5	"Besides that the paper is long, it is not too much feedback"
Misc3	Student1	1	I think your research is very relevant to OMSCS. I look forward to seeing your fin[lastname]gs and proposed solution.	9/13/2015 13:36	524	6	
Misc3	Student61	1	I like the idea. I've had to learn a lot of languages and each time I have to go through a search for the best resource and then begin to learn it. It would be nice to have a single resource that recognizes what i already know and leverages that to teach me something new. I look forward to the final product.	9/13/2015 13:45	7721	5	Wow someone else that would like to see this project come to fruition... If only my proposal gets approved.
Student38	Student61	1	"Wow those graphics woke me up and made me wish I'd done something similar :) The project sounds like a good one. If it were me, I'd be a little concerned that it could turn into a lot of work, so its good that you are already thinking of scoping the project a bit. I think you are likely to get some takers from the class for a beta test as these are the two languages we all seem to need over and over in OMSCS. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 13:37	453	5	Sure does seem like a lot of students would like a tool similar to the one I am proposing in my mini proposal... hint.. hint...
Student38	Student1	1	"This is a great topic and close to my heart, as I must surely fit into the category of ""non-traditional"" at age 57, working on my master's. I am curious about what you will find and come up with! I would also be curious to know (and maybe this was already part of the study) what factors exist for those non-traditional students that *are* successful in completing the degree. Are they conversely more engaged, or have more time, or have some special motivation? If you want to interview me at any point or include me in ""non-traditional student"" surveys, I'm happy to help. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 13:45	498	7	
Student38	Student93	1	Whew! I think you are already at the proposal draft stage as this is a very detailed project description. The project sounds quite ambitious but also very helpful to the segment of the population that suffers from this disease. It looks like you have already delved deeply and are well on your way - best of luck with your project!	9/13/2015 13:54	356	6	"Fine, I wrote the proposal"
Student38	Misc3	1	"This is a great idea. It solves a specific problem that you know exists and that you have substan[firstname]l domain knowledge about. I think it is a huge undertaking, however for one semester. I would advise scoping the project for your semester deliverable. For example, perhaps the detailed design or architecture could be the project for this semester, or perhaps an analysis of what is needed based on information you can obtain from industry. Then it could be built upon after that as you implement it in the real world later (if you do). If the project is too big, it will be hard to do it well *and* provide the presentation and paper that goes with it at the end of the semester. Great idea though - good luck!"	9/13/2015 14:00	555		
Student88	Student16	1	Well done in proposing something in a very short amount of words :) I felt I understood the concept and what you were trying to accomplish. I like how you narrowed your focus to k-12 as well. Do you have any thoughts on an interface yet? have you looked on github to see if there was anything you could leverage that already exists?	9/13/2015 14:16	627	5	
Student88	Student65	1	"This is very well thought out and I believe I have seen you post a few things to Piazza around this very topic. Some thoughts: Is this narrow enough to do this semester? Are you going to do it all or focus on one of the pieces? Did you look at edX and see if you could leverage that open education framework? With lots of questions how do you deliver feedback? This is something I have struggled with as well. Do you suggest going back to a particular topic? Do you say respond with predetermined responses that say why a particular answer is wrong? Do you give hints to the real answer? With lots of questions, how do you do this (or do you just bite the bullet and do it for everything) Also how do students review feedback? as they answer questions or at the end? Would it store incorrect questions that later get answered correctly? (I guess I made an assumption that they would be like Udacity quizzes, which is probably wrong) Does the student get to login and answer as many questions as they want for practice as well? Or do they get to take like a practice exam in the similar format under a time pressure?"	9/13/2015 14:27	507	7	
Student88	Student99	1	"Well done explaining it in a short concise method. I believe I read one of your earlier papers on the cosine methods and found it very insightful. You mention getting previous essays from the class. Hopefully no one has plagiarized so far, so how are you going to test your detection to verify an essay that is indeed plagiarized? Write something to test it? Is there somewhere else you can pull down examples from? Crowd source something maybe three quick 500 word essay on something easy from friends and have one totally plagiarize?"	9/13/2015 14:35	512	7	"I was thinking more about the methods for actually detecting the plagiarism, but you make a great point about how to go about getting input data. Thanks for the suggestion!"
Student88	Student41	1	"I believe this idea is awesome. There are times where as an online student I find myself wondering if only I could ask one clarifying questions real quick. I also wanted to point out that Udacity used to have a ""ask a question"" button as well as a ""watch this with your classmates/chat"" window. I don't remember seeing those recently. Another idea, is instead of relying on a network of SMEs, what if you built in a chat room for students watching courses to help ask and wonder about things and have a CME jump in there to help guide and assist as well. Then you could do something, very similar to CS6505/CCA, and have a group watch a lecture and ask questions as they go."	9/13/2015 14:44	502		
Student9	Student85	1	"I think you've made a decent case for the inclusion of technology and differen[firstname]ted instruction - I see a few gaps though - primarily - is a technological solution more efficient than simply hiring more teachers to deliver the instruction (I assume yes, but that remains to be seen). Where is the money going, presently? You also identified other nations as performing better - it'd be interesting to know more about what other nations are doing differently, and why the US is so far behind - or at least attempting to use that data to identify the highest value targets. This may not be entirely relevant to the work you want to do, but only to the argument for it's utility. Second is the issue of education quality - and I think you are right to bring attention to both the top and bottom end of the student body. I'm interested to see what you work on!"	9/13/2015 14:24	617	6	"Good points about following the money! I admit it's outside the scope of my project (and interest, honestly), but very important to consider."
Student9	Student33	1	"I think your proposal is great - so I'm only going to offer some thoughts on poten[firstname]l problems / criticisms to consider, and arguments to refute. Those are a lot of key reasons for educational differences - is there enough information to [firstname]ght / rank them? Where should the most time be spent? Given a shortage in STEM talent (and the high requirements for STEM work), wouldn't it be more productive to focus on raising the skill level of those who are average to above average, rather than raising below average to average? Are there educational advantages or synergies to focusing on disadvantaged kids (other than the moral reasons, which while compelling, haven't caused much improvement in the state of education in this country) How will compounded learning gaps (rea[lastname]g, writing, math) affect your design? Do you need to focus on core skills first - or can co[lastname]g act as a 'motivation' for developing those skills? Sounds like a great project. Good Luck!"	9/13/2015 14:34	878		
Student9	Student12	1	"An integrated course review framework sounds good - although are there existing solutions you could utilize to achieve the same thing? What are some of those core features you need to identify, and how do you intend to identify them? What about integrating the existing course feedback somehow - or making some of the data public? Are there concerns that stakeholders might have? What does a successful course review framework look like? What are some poten[firstname]l failures? Where do the 'silo'ed' review frameworks have an advantage? How will reviews update over time? Do reviewers get reviewed? Can the system identify my strengths and weaknesses? I look forward to seeing what you come up with."	9/13/2015 14:49	508		
Student9	Student30	1	"I hadn't seen Bloom's table before - that is useful for what I'm working on - so thanks! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the amount of educational technology since starting this course, as well as catching up on all of the philosophy. I'm surprised that there aren't more comprehensive lists of educational technology - do these lists exist in the domains themselves? I suppose I wonder a few things - who do you see this research benefiting most? Newcomers like me? Teachers? Technologists? Each of these groups will have their own frame of reference (for example, [firstname] classified on technology probably because the majority of this class is more familiar with tech than with Ed). What about the research will be novel? What connections do you hope to identify, and how do you plan to identify them? Lastly - the question I've been asking myself every day - How are you sure you aren't duplicating research? What work comes close, and where does it fall short? What work is recent, but only covers a specific domain? You've taken on a lot, but in any case - I'm sure next semester's student's will thank you. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 14:57	829		
Student22	Student24	2	"Hi [firstname], Well thought out mini proposal! I can see this being used in many of the courses in the OMSCS program. Your note about how much time auxiliary issues take such as team formation is quite insightful - as an instructor myself I've discovered only part of my actual time is teaching - so anything one can create that will make my life easier such as the tool proposed is quite welcome. A quick thought about your implementation - besides being able to pick students based on timezone, location etc. Also have them ranked in order of importance to you (i.e. the student) such as timezone or location over programming etc. Hence the first choice (out of five selected) could be given a [firstname]ghting of 5, the next 4, the next 3 etc.... at least I think that is how I would approach it. It seems to me you've taken the Tech Ed class to a programming class and meeting a need of Tech Ed - good idea."	9/13/2015 15:16	1292	7	Thank you [firstname]. Yes I have thought about using different priority levels for high level attributes. The instructors will be able to prioritize the attribute filters for running the Matching Algorithm.
Student22	Student17	1	Hello! I had a little trouble trying to figure out exactly what was being proposed (maybe because I did not see your earlier submissions) but it seems to me you're proposing a system in which teachers can share video and lesson plans. Your note about making these lesson plans widely available all over the world is actually a very good idea. I also like the idea that we could have sub-lessons for students as supplemental material if they are still struggling with a particular topic. Perhaps a quick diagram or picture or a mock up of a few screens will go along way towards explaining/clarifying your proposal.	9/13/2015 15:38	746		
Student22	Student72	2	"Hi [firstname], insightful paper Marie Montessori would be I think quite interested in seeing your report. Interestingly I think you�re on the right track and in doing research for my project I was looking a researcher from the 1870s who also talked about training techniques. See the work of Hermann Ebbinghaus regar[lastname]g memory and learning, some techniques are still used by the USAF today. I�m fin[lastname]g that some of the old ideas still apply today so I think you�re doing well. For your approach off-hand as a suggestion I think I would look at buil[lastname]g checklists of items to see similarities and differences. Another thought I had was what would Marie think of an iPad, Udacity or YouTube today � how would she approach the usage of those mediums?"	9/13/2015 15:51	750	6	I appreciate the ideas [firstname] shared on what Marie Montessori would think of Udacity and YouTube. I hadn't thought of that.
Student22	Student73	2	"Hi [firstname], I have to agree with you about all the systems being disconnected from one another yet they are all critical for a student success � it seems sometimes you have to reenter the same information again instead of having that information available to all the different applications. Just fixing that would be a big plus, at the moment I am somewhat resigned to �that�s how it is�� � I can see you want to fix that. I very much like the tool that you're proposing: �The Automated Advisor� I've wasted hours (and many others too) trying to find different things and it seems like for each course you have to really learn the geography all over again. �The Automated Advisor� would really help a student get into the class instead of navigating different websites just get the class started or were they stand currently in the program. I�ve noticed in recent semesters brand-new students in the program asking: �Where do I find this? Where do I find that?� I felt much the same about a year and a half ago � your tool will help solve that problem too."	9/13/2015 16:03	973		
Student59	Student32	1	"Interesting topic and good pitch. You mention that there are several existing solutions for this problem on the [firstname]et. I am curious as to what will make your's unique? Is it the use of the AI agent to do better question selection? Better analysis for better assessments? Your solution is very clear, but I am not as clear on what makes it special. No matter what, though, I think this will be an interesting project given solid execution."	9/13/2015 15:51	1205	6	
Student59	Student11	0	"Good as a strict ""elevator pitch,"" but perhaps a little short on details given the scope of the assignment. I do like the idea of being able to replicate the experience of raising my hand in the classroom (question pops into my mind, I want an answer *now* before procee[lastname]g too much further). However, I am unclear on how this is being accomplished: who is getting notified of the hand raise? What results can the raiser expect? These are questions that I would like to have seen answered in this mini-proposal."	9/13/2015 16:11	180		
Student59	Student52	1	"Let me try to rephrase your pitch in a single sentence: you're trying to conduct research on using physical manifestations of human emotions (movement, tone of voice) to improve intelligent tutoring systems. I'm curious if this will be all original research done on human subjects, or rather a detailed review and synthesis of existing research with a focus on this specific application. I did like the way you embraced the ""elevator pitch"" aspect of this assignment with your ini[firstname]l paragraphs. Well done!"	9/13/2015 16:14	299	7	
Student59	Student100	2	"Excellent clarity of vision! Many of the assignments I've reviewed do not present a precise idea of what their final deliverable will be, but it is clear here that you know exactly what you want to build. I can easily see how this tool would be useful for both the student and the teacher, and I think you've done a good job thinking out the ini[firstname]l feature set and how it will work within the context of what you're trying to accomplish."	9/13/2015 16:19	197		
Student76	Student79	1	"[firstname], I love the concept of using NLP tied to language learning. This is a natural utilization of NLP processes. Currently, in the domain, I see that most of the big products on the [firstname]et do have some semb[firstname] of ML in their software/systems (i.e. Rosetta Stone). The feedback I have for you is as follows: There are three things I would address moving forward. 1) Quite a few of the major products are actively working on creating authentic natural experiences. Rosetta stone has a feature that can par[firstname]lly-to-fully immerse the users. I would be interested in more illustration on how you are bringing something new to the domain (or packaging it in a unique, non-obvious manner) 2) It appears you want an immersive environment, but I don't see any mention of scaffol[lastname]g instruction. Optimally, your system is a form of intelligent tutoring system if it were to mimic a natural experience. Also, how are you going to handle audio as output (not just input)? 3) I don't see any mention of complexity. Do you think you can complete this project in a semester with/without help? Are you going to design this so someone else can co-opt the project? Maybe continue development afterward? This could be a very cool, yet highly ambitious project. Best of luck!

Student76	Student35	2	"First off, very well written paper. It went well above and beyond this week's requirements. I do not have too many points to add, but will attempt to do so. - This is non-important for your paper, but Agile (and agile) absolutely does endorse upfront planning and documentation. Planning is handled by design, and documentation is less formal (often times prototype code itself serves as the documentation) - ini[firstname]l requirements are still elicited. This is a huge common misconception for agile (and Agile). It is iterative, and requires fewer static documents, but that does not mean there is no planning and documentation involved. - What happens when a project is co-opted by an individual who is highly talented and teamwork adverse? In the case of an A project level submission, would teammates be penalized because someone else did the work before due time? - How do you measure handicaps from individuals? I.e. on several OMSCS projects, I've had ESL (or third language) students who were not as productive due to a huge language barrier. Our group as a whole worked around this situation and accepted the team-member; however he faced significantly more challenges to be a productive team member than the rest of us. Overall, this is the best paper I've read in class. I am encouraged that you are approaching this seriously and intelligently. I cannot wait to see the result. Student76reene Student76"	9/13/2015 17:28	1104		
Student76	Student82	1	"This idea is very value added. Actually, I remember a system like this being one of the final questions in Spring's KBAI class - my answer was substan[firstname]lly far more complex, so good job here! I would organize the future proposal a little more and make it refined. i.e. you gave two reasons that AES' were not used, and one didn't apply to OMSCS. Thus, I would like to see what gains you think you will see to enable the challenge of grade topicality. You will attempt to do this with some projects, but what ML and KBAI components will you use in the python libraries? Will this be extensible to both code review and English document reviews? Take my comments with a grain of salt - you more than adequately fulfilled the mini-proposal requirements. Student76reene Student76"	9/13/2015 18:50	545	6	"I haven't considered applying it to code reviews, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be. The plan is to score assignments written in English, but the neat thing about skip-thought vectors is that the reason it was created was for [lastname]slation. While I won't have time to properly test scoring assignments in other languages, I plan on developing my solution such that it would be very easy to extend to do so."
Student76	Student34	1	"Bobbi, awesome proposal. I have a few comments, but overall your project looks fantastic! 1) ""the work done there doesn�t lend itself well to auto-gra[lastname]g"" I don't follow. Some of it does not, yet much of the course material does. The most fun I had in this course was programming the python assignments. They even had an auto-grader for reductions - it was effective for the students who used it (it was optional). I think the issue in the course was more on educating how to bridge the theoretical to the practical. 2) Linking homework performance to expected exam results I would be very interested in fin[lastname]g the results of this. When I took the course in Fall '14, most of the people in my ""support"" group scored very high on the homeworks. Most of them were consistently high (around ~97% - 99%) with homeworks, with a vast range of different exam scores. Obviously, this is anecdotal evidence and may not be typical beyond the 7 of us. 3) I would be interested in the difference between feedback metrics and feedback content. I believe studies in OMSCS have shown that the metrics are accurate, but I doubt the content is sufficient for value. For example, the one time you (I think you are the only [firstname] in class) reviewed my document, you simply made and observation and asked a question. How am I supposed to respond? What value am I to derive unless more feedback than two sentences are provided? 4) What I'm fin[lastname]g in this program (and you've briefly alluded to) - those who are dedicated to the review process are more dedicated overall. THUS, I don't understand why you include the peer review portion in this project at all - you note that you wont get any controlled data. Is the point of the peer review to determine if the above assumption is incorrect? That is all I can see arising from this portion of the study. Best of luck with your project. I think the results will be very valuable; however, I do think this projects has multiple goals over the stated one - all important on their own. Student76reene Student76"	9/13/2015 19:07	1347		
Student6	Student66	1	"As a programmer, I salute your goals. I agree that not enough emphasis is placed on teaching syntax, and making syntax interesting enough to teach will be difficult. Are you planning on dynamically compiling the student's generated code, or comparing their answer to a set of known good answers? The feedback mechanism will be important, as there can be so many different types of syntax errors on a single line of code. Python is an interesting choice. I find that Python's usage of line spacing to determine statement block ownership frustrating. Teaching a younger person the importance of spacing in Python code is important, but will be challenging to stress its importance. The same could be said for using a semicolon for line termination in java. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 17:47	1027		
Student6	Student51	2	"I am surprised that there are no existing tools out there to accomplish what you are setting out to do. The organization of your mini-proposal is excellent. Your level of detail and explanation of the topic are why I believe it when you say that there are no existing tools out there to accomplish this task. I find your personal story very compelling, for me it works as an elevator pitch. A few ideas come to mind: 1. Video editing is typically processor intensive. Can you offload the processing to a cloud based server? 2. I'm not at all familiar with autism. Is there something about doing the videos yourself that is required? Is there any value in buil[lastname]g a community of shared videos? 3. Barring #2, is there value in buil[lastname]g a community of ideas for videos? If you as a parent are overwhelmed with the situation, that may ease some of the burden. 4. Can you take advantage of any shareware/freeware video editing tools to offload some of the work that you will need to do? Excellent proposal!"	9/13/2015 18:04	3607		
Student6	Student71	1	"Interesting format for this assignment. It is unique to have someone complete this assignment writing about themselves in the third person. I'm not sure that I understand the concept. The high level functionality to me video organization and searching. The interactive selection piece does sound unique. After my first read, it had the feel of the ""Choose your own adventure books"" I read growing up. Can you leverage existing video organizational and playback tools and ""bolt-on"" your interactive selection? The second portion is similar to the first. The ability to create scenario paths within a lesson seems unique. The filtering of background noise should be doable with existing tools though, no? Editing can be processor intensive, could you maybe send the data up to a cloud server for processing?"	9/13/2015 19:05	1013	6	Some interesting technology suggestions that I can take back to the group.
Student6	Student77	1	"This was a very unique presentation; the format was different from anything that I've seen from the other assignments that I have reviewed. For the most part I enjoyed it. Maybe it was due to the presentation format, but I was expecting the sourcing to be done traditionally, via footnotes or endnotes. You reference your assignment 2, but do not include it anywhere as something that can be reviewed. Overall, you have presented your topic succinctly and in a way that is visually appealing. As I read your submission multiple times though, I notice somewhat of a discrepancy. In the early part of your presentation, you state that you want to get rid of forums, but in your next steps, you discuss leveraging the forum platform. I think that you will have a lot of work in defining your project details. The first three steps that you have listed can take a significant amount of time. I hope that you will have time to complete that and build the prototype. Good luck!"	9/13/2015 19:22	991		
Student10	Student64	1	"I think that you've touched on a very important point - educational technology can actually end up widening an education and income gap rather than closing it. I remember rea[lastname]g that the vast majority of MOOC students had a college degree and income over $75,000. To counter your proposed solution though, I grew up in an upper middle class household but wasn't given access to a computer (or TV) until high school (mind you I am 29, so not a long time ago). I didn't learn how to program until the end of high school, and yet I've managed to get a math/CS degree from a good school and have a very good career as a software engineer. So I don't think that the problem was early access to computer science fundamentals. And so to that end, I would advise to not assume a solution just yet, because I think that the heart of the problem is a lot deeper. Your approach seems good though - interview people and discuss ideas."	9/13/2015 18:05	638	7	"Wow, thanks [firstname]! Good idea. I should not go into the project assuming anything."
Student10	Student58	1	"Personal gripe, but I really dislike the low completion rate argument against MOOCs. If 5000 people take a course, and 5% complete it, that's still 250 people completing the course - way more than would complete it on any campus. So I don't know that that is a bad thing. It's also 250 more than would have learned the content otherwise. However, increasing completion rates is obviously a good goal. Likewise, back before OMSCS I would usually take 2-4 Coursera courses and only finish 1 in any meaningful way - yet I think that I got great value out of them. The other question that I have is whether course completion rates and course grades are something to optimize for. It seems like there are easy variables here to affect these - make courses shorter, easier and have fewer assignment. Yet that doesn't seem like a great solution. Likewise, perhaps my favorite MOOC was Dan Grossman's Programming Languages course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang) - which is brutally difficult, time consuming and had a very low completion rate, yet was probably one of the most academically worthwhile classes I've ever taken. All that said - predicting student success is very important, but what remains in my mind is to define what student success is, and whether student success equates to the MOOC being a success (ie. is it better to have a few students get a lot of value out of a MOOC, or for a lot of students to get some value out of it?). So it sounds like a very interesting and worthwhile project."	9/13/2015 18:16	733	7	Well thought out response. The critique about the success metric is valid.
Student10	Student25	1	"This is a really neat idea. Back in undergrad, probably the coolest course I took was computer security. For the class, we read a bunch of papers from the 1990s (like Smashing the Stack for Fun and For Profit - http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html), and the professor then set up Linux VMs as Linux was at the time of the articles. Then we were tasked with using knowledge gained from the papers to crack both example programs, as well as actual programs. Needless to say, it was absolutely an mind blowing experience. Docker immediately comes to mind as a poten[firstname]l solution - https://www.docker.com/ - as it's easy to manage multiple docker instances, to distribute them and to update them. One question from rea[lastname]g your proposal: Why is ""cloud based"" important? Is it just that machines get out dated? I would guess that matters a lot for schools on tight budgets, but for students I would guess that it is less important as they probably update their stuff more frequently. Anyway though, very excited to see what you come up with!"	9/13/2015 18:50	454		
Student10	Student20	1	"What is the value of VR in an educational system. Any of these things could be implemented in a normal 2D screen - what does VR add to it? I could see physics as being one specific area, especially since you could do things that weren't physically possible, but outside of teaching physics, will VR actually help? That's not to say that it isn't worthwhile, but the way that you are selling it, VR sounds more like ""cool new tech I want to use"" over something that intrinsically adds value to educational software. I do like that Google Cardboard makes it really accessible, and so you should be able to distribute your software without too much trouble, and I do like the idea of simulating working as a doctor/engineer/etc - I think that could have a lot of value. Anyway, best of luck!"	9/13/2015 19:08	277

It sounds like you've been doing a significant amount of research, I wonder if you came across these: de Kleer, Johan, ""Using Crude Probability Estimates to Guide Diagnosis,"" Artificial Intelligence, vol. 45, 1990. de Kleer, Johan, ""Using Crude Probability Estimates to Guide Diagnosis,"" Artificial Intelligence, vol. 45, 1990.

Your thought process and development of the project has become more focused, and you have begun to develop an excellent roadmap towards accomplishing the project goals. I see that some of my earlier suggestions made it into this stage of the project's development; I'm honored. I like the state diagram, the only comment I would suggest since this will be ini[firstname]lly a stand-alone solution, build in an account registration process. The account registration component will then let the students and teachers enroll into the system. I suspect the enrollment page should query each student for the total number of earned credits, their targeted specialty, perhaps the list courses they've already completed or currently enrolled, and maybe their targeted graduation date. For the teachers, they could provide the list of classes they will be offering along with the number of TAs and Graders, (the # of TAs and Graders might be used to determine maximum class capacity), absolutely max capacity, any prerequisites, if necessary. Although not explicitly mentioned in the mini-proposal I assume that the outcome will be a list of courses and their forecasted enrollment numbers. What will be interesting and perhaps more challenging is to take into account the incoming class of new students have yet to register for any classes.

Student32	Student70	0	"Hi, [firstname], I am pleased to meet you. Please don't take this question the wrong way, but I failed to see how this project would somehow contribute to Education Technology. I think the best document that we have to help guide us in our endeavor was posted in Piazza here https://piazza.com/class/idf8nogyzhh6wf?cid=140. It references a document produced by the Office of Educational Technology: EdTech Developer's Guide. The Table of Contents is what I've been using to categorize how we've all been applying our research and/or design projects, here's a list of EdTech opportunity along with the page number where the opportunities are summarily defined: Opportunity 1: Improving Mastery of Academic Skills 7 Opportunity 2: Developing Skills to Promote Lifelong Learning 8 Opportunity 3: Increasing Family Engagement 10 Opportunity 4: Planning for Future Education Opportunities 11 Opportunity 5: Designing Effective Assessments 11 Opportunity 6: Improving Educator Professional Development 12 Opportunity 7: Improving Educator Productivity 13 Opportunity 8: Making Learning Accessible to All Students 15 Opportunity 9: Closing Opportunity Gaps 17 Opportunity 10: Closing Achievement Gaps 17 Regardless, I still like your project; it is very intriguing albeit challenging. If I were to categorize the project, I would say that it would assess the validity of the blog entries. I am curious how the smart agent would qualify and, if applicable, quantify the validation of a blog entry. Would you spawn background engines that would search for similar statements or claims? However, this approach would bring up another interesting challenge: ""...just because a group of people makes a claim doesn't make it so"". I guess what I'm curious what exactly will the smart agent do, how will it do it? Will the smart agent also have a metacognitive component so it can learn from its assessments, mistakes, etc.?

You state the majority of software aimed at elementary level is a collection of basic patterns. Is this intentional due to mental development models? Is there another reason for that? 2. Would you have to create your own content? I can understand the career angle but how would you include a student into something like a Veterinarian or Software developer or Writer? There are a ton of options someone can choose for a career field today and if you could generalize career fields or make the student an ""assistant"" to someone in the field that helps them solve a specific problem to ""help"" them. I looked up the google cardboard and I think this is a great use of an existing open source solution.

I almost gave up on the program but then the only class I could get into for the summer was KBAI, I had almost no background in AI and had a lot of trepidation about the course but found it engaging and interesting.

I have tried to develop a Raspberry Pi intro to co[lastname]g class/session https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning but found unexpected lack of interest from local institutions.

Student83	Student75	1	"The problem is well described, and it looks like you have put quite a bit of thought into the architecture of the solution. It looks to me that this solution will mirror the data needed to perform its work outside of OSCAR - have you done any research on whether you could integrate this directly with OSCAR to avoid the problem of duplicate data and maintaining up to date information about students and courses?"	9/13/2015 21:47	1032	5	"Yes, [firstname] - I mentioned about the data sync.

I don't necessarily seek out blogs directly, but rather am looking for something specific and come across blogs through Google searches. It is reasonable to assume that PageRank promotes higher quality content, but after thinking about it I think you are right - probably some of the best information is buried in pages with low number of links, and thus a low PageRank score. To be able to search for a topic and have results come back in order of quality would be very worthwhile.

Are you inten[lastname]g to have this be general for all labs (chemistry, physics, biology, etc.) or do you have a specific course or subject in mind?

Student65	Student16	1	"[lastname], I'm a high school computer science and calculus teacher and this sounds like a good and very practical project. Memorization is not a learning technique relevant to the courses I teach, but I can see it being more valuable in some other types of courses, such as English, where they may be working on SAT prep with vocab. I might suggest trying to scope it around a particular subject, at least to start, so you can come up with test data to get started with. Then determine the scalability and generalization of the concept to other classes. At the elementary level, this would be invaluable. I can see using automated flash cards for math facts or science vocabulary. The only concern I might have is existing tools. The idea of spaced repetition per an algorithm that looks at how the student did on similar questions to determine what questions to ask next is intriguing. All of that said...[firstname] J. mentioned your name to me and said you may be looking to partner with others for this class project.

Student65	Student42	1	"Nick, this is an interesting phenomenon. The first thing I thought when I read the problem statement was why are low socioeconomic children exposed to less complex conversation than other children? Perhaps you addressed this in an earlier assignment, but this really made me think about how that could come about. Things like opportunity, better schools, resources at home, etc. are obvious, but conversation struck me as a peculiar side effect of socioeconomic status. This is definitely an interesting research area, and a difficult problem since those most affected would have access to the least amount of resources, inclu[lastname]g early childhood education since such education is usually expensive, and as you mentioned, too late. The only concern I would have about a technology based solution to this problem is whether you can mimic the natural language learning through exposure with an artificial tool. A question you might want to ask is ""Can guided, planned learning replace experience with human interaction?"" This is an interesting area of research for which a tool like what you propose could provide a way to counteract a disadvantage to make a difference in education."	9/13/2015 22:39	2117		
Student65	Student41	1	"I like the idea of being able to ask a question during an online training session. But at the same time, I am a little skeptical of this idea of a live person ""on call"" to answer questions. Online compliance or other trainings I've participated in might have been completed in the middle of the night, for example. I wonder if a forum based Q&A might suffice for this? I do understand the idea of immediate answers though, but if an SME isn't available, then they wouldn't get immediate feedback anyway. That said, if it did work with available SMEs and timely responses, it would be a good addition to existing online trainings.

Student65	Student99	2	"As a computer science teacher, this strikes a cord with me, as cheating happens. You hate when it does, but it does happen. The plagiarism question for essays is very different from code. Sometimes with lower level projects for beginners, for example, the code is so simple that it may be difficult to detect if a submission is a copy of another student's work or if the two (or more) submissions are so similar because the project level was low with not much possible variation in solutions. Of course, at the higher level of more complex projects this will not be a factor. So one question I would consider is the level or type of projects that can be checked. For essay based assignments, will you be using simple text comparison or will you use some sort of language processing AI agent to determine if a student's paper has strong sentiment matches to another paper (i.e. if the student para-phrased another student's work, it might not get caught as a direct text match, though it might hold a fairly constant theme or sentiment)? From the short explanation in the essay, it looked like you would use some KBAI concepts, if I understood correctly. That's a very interesting approach. I might wonder how many ""styles"" might be considered unique, and how this might work if you have many students and some share similar writing styles. I didn't understand most of the ML concepts you were describing, but you piqued my interest.

Your topic's interesting. Most of the tools suggested in class to evaluate text-based-input I've been a little leery of. Not because I don't think they'd be useful, but there's a linguistic element to these problems that's significantly more complicated than the computer science element (in my opinion -- perhaps I've not a very good linguist!). However, I think that your proposal is the exception. It sounds like you've got a realistic statement of work and you understand the technical requirements. I'll make one suggestion to avoid over specification. That is, you don't want to limit the domain of your tool too much such that it's not ultimately useful.

You could approximate quality with length (I'm not saying it's a hugely accurate approximation, but it's indicative of someone's time investment in the average case). I think you've got a very interesting but practical research project. I'd give a close look at how you're going to measure ""improving the student experience"" as well as your correlation to performance.

Use something like Feedly or something similar to find the top 100 or so blogs in each broad category and then have a page to allow blog owner to submit their own blog for rating. Sounds like your metadata is a mix of easily automated and manual data entry. For Topic, is this a multiple choice or single choice thing? Keywords might be better here. How do you determine the ""very well known""ness of an Author? And what does this do for the rating? What about blogs without any notion of ""followers?"" Seems like this would skew results. Comments are on blog entries, usually. Not on blogs. Will this then be an aggregate thing? In addition to date of last entry, you'd also want some kind of activity-level rating (minimally to fill your ""tren[lastname]g"" blogs list). Might include number of comments in that to gauge popularity. IMO, no reason for a mobile app, here. Really only need a mobile friendly web site. But at most you could just wrap this site in PhoneGap or similar if you really wanted it in a store."	9/13/2015 22:23	676	6	
Student100	Student32	1	"This is a really saturated field that will be difficult to enter with any success. The biggest issue is that every LMS already has a built-in quiz engine that can be used to generate practice quizzes from a question bank based on a set of criteria. I'm sure I'm being closed minded here, but I'm not seeing where this tool really moves the needle enough to make me step outside of my LMS. And for those without LMS's, Socrative (and a couple others) really do seem to fill this niche. The direct link to a question bank is a compelling differen[firstname]tor. But I'm not really sure what common question banks you're referring to. In my experience, most question banks are a complete mess. Usually poorly formatted Word docs created by book authors. There's no standard. Maybe you've found a good standard (SCORM would seem a good start) and a solid set of sources? If so, then this might be a compelling addition to this field. Otherwise, though, I'm not seeing the ""special sauce"" here. Fun project, no matter what. Unique contribution? Not sure."	9/13/2015 22:34	1021

Student100	Student75	0	"Went a bit beyond the ""elevator pitch"" here and perhaps a little far into the actual proposal. But better more than not enough. Seems like a pretty good project idea to me. A few considerations. * Some courses can be taught ""compressed"" in the Summer. Some can't. * Some courses will have a realistic maximum (regardless of number of TA's) and each course will have a different TA/student ratio. * Students can take up to 3 courses per semester (1 in the summer). But this should be configurable since this has been in flux. * ""Seniors"" is not the correct term for grad school, but the consideration is good. Students with two or fewer semesters remaining should be given priority. * It would be nice if the system could also account for the specific courses already completed by each student so there's no accidental attempts to assign that student to a course he/she can't take (assuming all preferences are full). * UI idea--create a 3-row swimlane diagram. One for ""More Desirable"". One for ""Less Desirable"". One for ""Undesirable/Cannot Take"". All courses that could be taken should be prefilled in the Less Desirable lane. Courses already taken in the Undesirable/Cannot Take"" column. Students can drag and drop courses between columns. Perhaps have a maximum number of courses in the More Desirable column. * It's going to be hard to get students to fill this out unless it becomes a required part of the registration process. Without near 100% input, the system will not really do much more than the current system (i.e., filling out a survey every semester). Anyway, a worthy project.

I feel that if you are more engaged and feel confident of your own learning, you are more willing to help out. Also a passive learner like me would post rarely on piazza, however, would spend more time writing peer feedback. Perhaps counting number of words or lines ? 2. Type of learner ( Active or passive ) may be an important indicator as well. Not sure how you will collect this though. May be this information can be derived from the course surveys. 3. Also extra credit: Those who would aim for extra credit, in spite of getting a good grade in the course. I believe KBAI has that. Two to three assignments are optional in that course, but i believe some do complete them. They do not count towards grade. If i think of other things i will just send you a message on Piazza!

That makes sense. To have a focused curriculum on IS seems to be viable objective. How to provide that to a mass audience is tricky? I would suggest narrowing the focus for this project to developing the delivery framework. For instance, you focus on: User login and profile Course listing Courses to meet goal level (i.e. IS Technician, IS Engineer, Sr. IS Engineer) Tracking user progress in meeting goal Partner login and profile Search for IS job candidates And keep the actual content offering really small and not necessarily complete. More of prototype content if you know what I mean. Definitely an interesting idea, just sounds really big. Are you doing this with a group? That would certainly making it more doable in this course timeframe. Good luck!"	9/14/2015 11:29	11

Student72	Student54	1	"If I understand the premise of your project correctly, that online students cheat more than on-campus students, and that this must be stopped to ensure the academic integrity of online degree programs, I'm just not sure I agree. This paper came to a different conclusion when comparing integrity of on-campus students to online students: http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/spring131/watson131.html But, maybe I misunderstand you and your goal is to make online degree programs operate at an even higher level of student integrity than on-campus students. Or is that all students regardless of online or encompass should be held to the highest expectations where absolute no cheating is acceptable and you strive to develop a means to prevent the dishonest behavior and find and punish those that are dishonest. Anyway, just sharing some thoughts that came to mind. Good luck with your project."	9/14/2015 15:42	2723		
Student17	Student54	1	"Hi [firstname], I think that your concept is most certainly accurate. In my opinion, it is absolutely essen[firstname]l, possibly even more so than in-person programs, that academic integrity is upheld. I also think that your two-part solution of prevention and enforcement is valid in uphol[lastname]g academic integrity. I also agree with instructors taking a stronger part in explicitly stating aspects of academic honesty. I�ve had many classes where only a general policy is taken. On the other hand, I�ve heard of some classes that explicitly prohibit student collaboration. This leads to a much less effective learning environment when students are not able to generate helpful class discussions and learn from each other. I believe that your product has a strong foundation and look forward to seeing how it expands."	9/14/2015 12:16	1624		
Student17	Student72	1	"Hello, I think that you have a very interesting topic in introducing technology directly into the classroom.

Student17	Student73	1	"Hello [firstname], I'm so glad that you've decided to investigate this topic. The fact that so many student resources are across so many different platforms is often jarring. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say it's not ideal that we're using so many different platforms rather than a single integrated tool. Another solution that I've thought of that you may want to investigate is the use of RESTful API's. If the different platforms created API's that allowed their data to be accessed, one could possibly create a single platform that uses their data. Really surprised we don't have this already, great concept!"	9/14/2015 12:58	5236

It makes students, or at least myself, very anxious about not only fin[lastname]g a group, but also fin[lastname]g the right group. Facilitation of group creation by your proposed tool certainly would save a lot of heartache and headache in forming groups for classes. I think that CS-6300 did a great job in having students be surveyed and matching their skills up with other students to create well-rounded teams. Developing this process into a tool would be extremely ideal so that it could be used across other classes."	9/14/2015 15:16	5	6	Thank you [firstname].

Student18	Student52	1	Hi [firstname] I absolutely love your idea. I am also interested in developing something that can assist educators in detecting learners� emotions during their learning process. I think we are looking at the same problem but trying to approach it from different angles. During my research phase I came across a research project that is also trying to achieve the same. It is called �Affective Learning Companion� from MIT media lab and I learned much from this project. Do check the project site: http://affect.media.mit.edu/projectpages/lc/AI-ED.html	9/14/2015 14:42	1064	7	
Student58	Student8	1	"The great thing about this project is it has the poten[firstname]l to just be a tool for people with special educational needs (which is admirable on its own), but also a tool that could be a part of promising research in the area. The game could have data tracking incorporated in a way that would allow for researchers to study the impact of the Social Stories on the student. The other thing you should consider is how you would build a ""teacher's toolbox"" for the game. I don't know much about education for children with Autism, but I suspect that the education process is very specialized per student. If the game could have a level creator that could be tailored to a child's specific needs that could be very powerful as an education tool."	9/14/2015 15:42	839	7	"I agree with his statement, I want to add data tracking as well and I want it to be a way to mine for data. I also would love to have a teacher's toolbox but that would definitely be a down the road thing."
Student58	Student80	2	"This was really interesting. How strongly does cheating correlate with freeloa[lastname]g? Cheating seems like in general a more deliberate act, whereas freeloa[lastname]g may not be as intentional for some of those doing it. I would have guessed that those who demonstrate evidence of cheating in games would be more likely to join a group with the goal of freeloa[lastname]g, while a significant portion of freeloa[lastname]g group members would simply lack motivation or time management to contribute to the level of their other group members. Also, since everyone seems much more conscious of their own work rather than those around them, I wouldn't be surprised if every group member thinking the others were freeloa[lastname]g was a common occurrence. Group selection could be improved this way and groups where everyone was a contributor would really benefit. The one concern I would have is the groups that were full of members who showed poten[firstname]l as freeloaders. You've created a group of people who have demonstrated a willingness to cheat. I'd image they would have a huge poten[firstname]l for academic dishonesty."	9/18/2015 22:23	1235	6	"The feedback is forward looking and has ideas that might be interesting and useful to explore in future research. Cheating is of course where I started, but freeloa[lastname]g seems easier to examine. The ramifications of creating groups of freeloaders is also worth noting.

Student58	Student25	1	Do you envision this as a project focusing on post-secondary education or at some other level? Would the level of education matter in this case or will the best practice recommendations be generalized enough that level can be ignored?

Group formation tends to be a very organic process oncampus- where people just sort of g[firstname]tate into groups- and if you asked them, they'd have no idea how they chose, itd just be inklings they got, or something somebody said or the way they said it. These interactions cant really exist in a manageable form in a MOOC, and i really think your system could solve that. To go further: what if there were a more behind-the-scenes way to do this, with analytics. Students submit a few solo assignments, feed their data into an algorithm, find poten[firstname]l groups -> super scalable."	9/14/2015 16:13	293	6	I liked the feedback in general.

Student24	Student54	1	"Hi [firstname], The topic of academic Integrity and plagiarism is a very sensitive one. I agree with you that although every student is generally aware of academic Integrity policies,most of them don't take it very seriously. Its like buying a new credit card, most people don't carefully read the fine print for the terms of usage. I think the reason is also that this is not being discussed openly although every class requires you to understand the academic Integrity policies. I heard some instances of this in KBAI class last semester, which again brings into light the whole issue. I believe Academic dishonesty is not a new phenomenon. It has been prevalent in higher education for a few decades now. With the ever increasing reach of Internet it has became more so common place. It makes it that much easier for students to plagiarize someone else works as their own. Having a tool which can help identify the the plagiarism will prove to be a great asset. It will certainly help to address the issue in proper manner and prevent more such incidences. On other note is your tool going to do any code comparison for identifying plagiarism? It will be interesting to see how your tool can handle the code comparison, since its very difficult to identify similarities in code being readily available through open source. I would be interested to see how your tool distinguishes between someone unknowingly omitting to reference the source of their research or purposely using someone else work? I believe one of the students is also planning to study the behavior which causes students to engage in plagiarism. In will be interesting to see the outcome of our enforcing rules in the light of that study."	9/14/2015 17:20	372

I agree there is a ever growing need for Information security professionals, but I am highly skeptical if this problem can be addressed so easily with some tool.

OMSCS program is currently offering a semester based class ""Intro to Information security"" to cover just the basics. Many Universities offer Major and Minor degrees in just the ' Information Management and Security"". I would be interested to know the source of education material to use for your tool?

I think (not sure if there is research on this) that games are usually based on risk-reward feedback and are designed to engage the more instinctual reactions. There are still some pretty complex games that require more committed thinking. I work on League of Legends which is one such game. People spend enormous amounts of time studying other play styles and game statistics to improve their play. But harnessing these instinctual urges for educational purposes is truly a challenge.

That said, I think the most important part of this is getting them to not leave all of the challenges of technology management to the third grade science teacher as you say. That said, if you were able to somehow lower the barrier to entry so that they don't have to pay someone a full-time salary just to manage their technology, I think you will be met with open arms by the school districts."	9/14/2015 19:40	2152		
Student66	Student19	1	"Hey, I am also looking to do game-based learning to help youth learn programming. I definitely know what you mean as to the difficulty of narrowing down to a particular topic. I personally did some soul-searching and I realized that there was a huge gap between early programming education and the more mature computer science people encounter in college and professional life. I think that the biggest difference is the inclusion of not-as-entertaining topics like syntax. I am seeking to include that in the game in a fun way so as to ease the shock later on. I think you're definitely thinking about all the right things in terms of execution. If I were you, I would start by picking a particular age group (elementary, middle, high school, etc.) and try to answer the question, ""What are they missing that my game can give them?"" That will definitely help you pinpoint a particular part of computer science to hone in on. Good luck!"	9/14/2015 20:59	931	7	
Student66	Student53	1	"This is a cool idea and you've named a lot of important parts to help reduce customer churn. Are you planning on creating a tool to help actually reduce customer churn for a particular application or a general framework upon which others could create training material/quizzes/tests to evaluate customer engagement/knowledge? You could also probably make this into a full-blown research project identifying metrics which are telltale signs of customer knowledge. I think that the concept you brought up has a lot of poten[firstname]l but that you should try and start narrowing down the scope of your project. Creating the framework, a method to analyze users, and a method to try and improve their knowledge going forward might be a bit too much for a single semester. Best of luck!"	9/14/2015 21:21	732		
Student53	Student46	1	"Hi [firstname], I like your project! And I think the audience is more broad, it could be anyone that wants to learn how to program. Nowadays there are people without a tech background that want to get into IT. This would definitely help them get jumpstarted with the basics One suggestion I have is to be more clear about the problem you are trying to tackle in the introduction, in the first paragraph you explain how you got into the idea, but not as much as to what is the problem or opportunity why teaching binary is relevant. By contrast I liked the conclusion, where you make it clear why this app is needed inclu[lastname]g a comparison against what is out there."	9/14/2015 20:04	2538	6	This feedback was helpful and has raised some issues which need examining.
Student53	Student28	1	"Hi [firstname], I think one of the peer feedbacks I gave in Assignment 2 was someone in your team, as the idea looks similar. That being said, I like how the ideas are progressing and becoming more concise. This mini proposal looks good, the problem is clear, the proposed solution as well. One suggestion I have would be to include something related to the community, like an opt-in directory of everyone in the program, it could include where people work, live, what they do, specialties, linke[lastname] profiles. One of the parts I like with OMSCS is that we are buil[lastname]g a community, so making easily available poten[firstname]l people to connect with would be great. In regards to the hosting, have you considered Georgia Tech resources? Not sure if that is possible but maybe worth checking."	9/14/2015 20:46	4405	7	"Great suggestion on the ""opt-in"" to share more detail contact information with each other to foster further OMSCS community buil[lastname]g."
Student53	Student7	2	"Hi Ben, This looks great, I look forward to what comes out of this project. The mini proposal is very well explained from the problem, to solution and justification. Depen[lastname]g on the number of topics this might turn out to be a very big project, my suggestion would be to take to completion (of the 5 steps) 1 or 2 of the topics from step 1. This could be like the foundation / POC of a project that you can continue working on the long run. As for the ""process of buil[lastname]g a larger application"" if the target is existing developers then it could work out, but for new developers that might be too overwhelming I think."	9/14/2015 22:25	1311		
Student53	Student96	2	"Hi [firstname], This sounds like a very interesting and different idea from what I've seen in other projects. The part I like about this project is creating a community from a different point of view to the online communities that already exist and to have as deliverable a paper that others can learn from towards applying a similar concept. I do wonder how your community will differen[firstname]te from the others you mention, so it definitely seems like the paper you generate will be worth rea[lastname]g. For the mini proposal, a small explanation of what software you wrote would've been great to get more context. PS: Congrats on the baby!"	9/14/2015 22:47	1907	6	
Student29	Student26	1	"Very good paper, and explanation. I did not know what PBL was, and you explained it well."	9/14/2015 20:51	1041	4	I'm going through all this feedback at once and they surely fluctuate A LOT in terms of helpfulness
Student29	Student50	1	"I like this idea, and I can tell you have put your passion and a lot of thought into it. I think it would have wide-ranging effects on OMSCS and other higher learning venues."	9/16/2015 21:51	111		
Student29	Student60	1	"This is an interesting idea. I found myself agreeing and nod[lastname]g along with the section around ""group formation"" and the psychological ""buddying up"" you mentioned. Very apt paper, I'm curious to see what you come up with ."	9/16/2015 21:53	135	6	The feedback was inspirational.
Student29	Student98	1	"You hit the nail on the head. I think it's a wonderful idea to have the learner view progress reports for the goals they have set for themselves. I don't think I've ever seen or heard of that as an enticement - I've always seen it as an afterthought. That engages the learner to first define their goals, most likely making them more excited about learning. I'm visualizing the bored high school student in this scenario. Good job."	9/16/2015 21:55	158	6	"The review was helpful in determining if this project should be research or tool based. Reviewer also pointed out that they have never heard or seen of this idea. This makes me want to pursue the idea past the end of class to full production. If they students start early with defining their goals, they will continue the tradition throughout their life."
Student48	Student38	1	"Great mini-proposal. You did a great job describing the problem of plagiarism. t would be interesting to describe some of the tactics you plan to investigate to and may implement in order to create a solution to this problem. Specifically what part of plagiarism detection will you solve; user interface, reporting, detection, or collection/processing data sets."	9/14/2015 21:34	412		
Student48	Student49	1	"Very interesting mini proposal. I'm curious to see where the framework you build goes. Do you plan to focus on a specific topic of training for your ini[firstname]l design, and where will your framework source the training material from?"	9/25/2015 1:25	297		
Student48	Student92	1	great idea for creating an interactive feedback of learning between the teacher and students with the automated tutorial system. While not a perfect solution I'd suggest docker containers to run the code in. which will give you some sandboxing capabilities without investing in in a full fledged VM system for your prototype.	9/25/2015 1:30	245		
Student48	Student68	2	"excellent idea, and great collection of resources also. Being able to improve course material for CS k-12 is a great idea. I'm curious if insite and material could be gained by working with authors like, Linda Liukas who created the ""Hello Ruby"" young children book and learning program on kickstarter several months ago. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lindaliukas/hello-ruby"	9/25/2015 1:34	344		
Student44	Student55	1	"This is a very interesting and relevant topic. I have a lot of experience with knowledge management and agree w/ you that a technological solution could help w/ academic advising. My feedback falls into two categories: paper structure and style, and proposed solution. STRUCTURE & STYLE: Your writing style is very pleasant and easy to read. The logic in your paper flows well. The background you provided introduces the problem well and supports your proposal. Good job there. I have a couple of recommendations for you: 1. Come up w/ a better descriptor than �very good ones.� That phrase really stuck out for me. 2. Recommend you start to organize you content into sections based on subject now. For example the first four paragraphs could be titled: �Background,� and the remaining paragraphs titled: �Proposed Solution.� 3. Recommend you add an introductory paragraph at the beginning in a section titled: �Problem� or something semantically similar. In that section state the problem and the recommendation you are going to propose in the paper in 3-4 sentences. This is important b/c it sets the stage up front for what the reader should expect to find in the paper. Research papers should not read like a mystery novel. For example, I did not know what the problem you were going to address was until I hit paragraph five in the paper. I expected to read about the problem in the very first paragraph of the document. PROPOSED SOLUTION: What follows are some ideas for you to think about and consider when flushing out the remaining details of your paper. 1. Regar[lastname]g your four major components: I want to help you think through your solution. To do so, you need to visualize each component as a process, which has an input, process(es) and an output. I recommend you create a process flow diagram to help you visualize them this way, and define your input data, explain the process, define your output data. If you�ve never created a process flow diagram before, Google it�it�s pretty easy and straight fwd. 2. Recommend you also describe components in terms of input; process; output. Currently you use verbs such as: �allows� and �considers.� Recommend [lastname]ing to: �The use profile collects student data to establish a base for advising. Data collected includes�.. This data is used as an input to the �planner.� The Planner analyzes the student profile and based on a very complex and proprietary algorithm I have yet to develop, provides a list of courses along with�data. If you follow these recommendations, you will produce a high level architecture that can be converted into a functioning system with a little more details. Great idea! Good luck w/ it."	9/14/2015 21:18	2526		
Student44	Student67	1	"The topic you chose is very near and dear to my heart. I am passionate about motivating people. I even started down the road you are going down now only to let it go b/c the problem was too complex and too difficult to wrap my head around in this class. However, let me try to help you though. In your submission ""[firstname]"" is a distraction and red herring. He is not your target audience b/c he is incentivized by his occupation and employer to continue his education. At a minimum he must complete 3-6 continuing ed classes annually to maintain his teaching certificate. So I recommend you cut [firstname] out of this paper completely. Now, let's focus on describing who your target audience really is in terms of: age, education, income, nationality, race, religion, sex, family life cycle (i.e., married, single, divorced, etc.) and family size. Have fun with it and try to describe your target in as many of these demographic variables as you can. You don't have to use them all...but should. Doesn't matter to me what choices you make...but make a choice so you will have an target group profile. Once you've done that, begin your paper by describing this group of people, state why they are incentivized to attend school, and propose how you want to motivate them to go to online school (or whatever fits). Then research what motivates the particular group of people you described. What things do they like, not like (i.e., activities, colors, jobs, etc.)? Then design a solution based on your research of what interests/motivates this group. Create a phone app that will be interesting to this group of people, backed up by empirical research. Then ta da you'll have a great paper! I love this topic. Hope my feedback helped. If not, don't give it a second thought...just ignore it and move on. Good luck."	9/14/2015 22:00	2704	7	
Student44	Student47	1	"[lastname]: Interesting topic. Good start, however I'm going to recommend that you seriously consider focusing on a smaller set of student population. K-12 is too broad a range to define a single solution b/c children [lastname]e dramatically over that range and what works for a K student won't work for a 12 student. That is the primary reason that schools in Am[firstname]a are generally divided categorically into Elementary (K-5), Middle (6-8) and High (9-12) for that very reason. Once you pick a subset of students, you'll find a wealth of academic research on what works best in controlling children in that segment of the population. Very interesting topic. Good start. Good luck!"	9/14/2015 22:45	394		
Student44	Student36	1	"[firstname]: Very interesting topic and a decent start. My recommendations are designed to help you focus and flush out the details you need to complete your paper. 1. I was confused by your first paragraph when you started out: ""This research will focus on the particular phenomenon that occurs with educational software that relies on a community to fuel the content."" I do not understand what phenomenon you are talking about here. Recommend you elaborate for those who are not familiar. 2. Later in the first paragraph you state: ""The goal of the research is to determine what the benefits and detriments for each tool using a series of metrics, and aggregate the successful feature qualities into meaningful implementation requirements that can develop into features that enhance the community user experience."" This is good and what I believe you intend to focus on. Given that, you need to define the ""metrics"" you are going to use and explain why you chose them. In research, you must in this order: define what you are going to measure first; then measure to manage, and finally manage to control. In you next submission, I'm expecting to see a finite set of well defined metrics, and then a list of academic software you intend to evaluate. This would include a short paragraph explaining each and perhaps a URL to the product's website. Eventually, I anticipate you'd have some type of matrix of the data for comparison purposes. Great start! Looking forward to rea[lastname]g the next iteration."	9/14/2015 22:58	547	6	"The details of 1 and 2 are sorted out in a future assignment. Most of his suggestions I included in that future assignment as well, other than the URL links to the website. I did explain the access to research links in my first draft assignment, which includes coverage of public/private group access for data."
Student71	Student19	2	Very well organized and thought out. Good references supporting your reasoning for your approach.	9/14/2015 22:01	898	4	
Student71	Student77	1	"I think you are on the right track with passive learning. Tagging/labeling subjects can provide easier searches. We do something very similar in our internal wiki where I work. Another thought you may consider is the option of allowing some sort of notification to be sent to students who select to receive such notifications. For example, you could allow a student to set tags they are interested in notifications on and have various delivery methods. Perhaps messaging or emails to that student to simply say a new forum has been started regar[lastname]g a subject the student is interested in. The student can ignore it, but it could contain just enough info that perhaps they will remember it is out there if a situation occurs where one needs to access that subject."	9/14/2015 22:16	3608		
Student71	Student66	1	"I like your idea of using drag and drop blocks of code. I think learning logic is fine but learning logic AND the syntax presents a better long term understan[lastname]g. I think also you might (and maybe you thought of this) allow the player to enter the code vs. drag and drop and award bonus points. Would have to make the decision to enter code before being offered choices. I'm not sure if I'm understan[lastname]g how the game will work so this idea may not make sense. In any case, really like the idea of seeing the code."	9/14/2015 23:16	1781		
Student71	Student3	1	"Working in this space I'm sure there is very little I can suggest that you haven't already thought of. I do know that selling to administrators and school boards is more about politics than practicality and logic. I do wish you success in your efforts. Too many times there is pressure on school districts to be ""technologically advanced"" without consideration to what that really means."	9/17/2015 23:50	2199	4	Thanks. At least there is an understan[lastname]g of the project at hand.
Student40	Student81	1	"Hi [firstname]! Very neat project idea, I'd very much like to get my hands on a HoloLens as well (I saw the ini[firstname]l videos during the Microsoft IGNITE conference earlier this year). I guess my only concern would be whether or not you'd be able to receive a HoloLens quickly (I'm not sure how long Microsoft's process will take on their end, and whether they are going to be giving out units right away once their awards are announced on October 6. It seems like you're in a very unique/cool position though within the Army to get this going, so I doubt you'll run into trouble...good luck and I hope I get to read some of what you discover during the course of the semester ;-)!"	9/14/2015 23:59	524	6	"That concern is shared and I have a course of action for research in the event I am not able to get an actual device. It's always good to ""Be Prepared"""
Student40	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"Hi Kamran! This is definitely an interesting area to investigate. I know with my own courses (programming ones) I've wondered how best to create these ""ill-structured"" problems that provide enough structure to provide a foundation, along with enough unknowns to make solving the problem interesting for the students (rather than it just being a tutorial they are following). I know you're not focusing on the ""How-to create ill-structured problems"" question, but in general I think it'll be interesting to see what you'll come up with and how it might be useful for instructors :-)."	9/15/2015 0:08	410		
Student40	Student13	1	"Hi [firstname]! I wish I was as knowledgeable/comfortable as you are at doing what I feel is real research (rather than the project-oriented approach I tend to go with since it's a lot more comfortable for me to feel productive). I don't have much to add to your mini-proposal as the overall process seems thought out. From my end I think my main question would be if you're able to get all of the data variables you're mentioning (I'm assuming that Professor Joyner would be able to help get some of that from Udacitiy/GATech to help with the research)? So far I haven't taken KBAI or any sort of artificial intelligence / machine learning course, but I recently purchased a few of these Learning Paths that were just announced from O'Reilly: http://shop.oreilly.com/category/learning-path.do so I'm hoping I can go through the machine learning one and start picking up some of the basics so I don't feel like such a newbie when I take the related courses here in OMSCS. Also, thanks for sharing your experiences with Co[lastname]Game and just sharing it period. I'm going to try using it in the PHP course I'm teaching this semester and see how the students enjoy it (it's neat the site supports so many languages :-)."	9/15/2015 0:15	1073		
Student40	Student5	1	"Hi [firstname]! I really like your overview of all of the information silos we have in the program (I remember in our first semester I created one of those Google Spreadsheets right before classes started and people started sharing information about themselves, but in general, information is spread all over the place and it can be hard to keep track of things just as you described so it's definitely a real pain point for students). So I very much look forward to what your team is able to put together throughout this semester :-)! I'm also curious if anyone on your team has created add-ons for the open source Wiki projects you mentioned that might poten[firstname]lly be used? Using my own project I've proposed as an example, I can definitely say there's pros and cons to buil[lastname]g add-ons on top of existing solutions vs. buil[lastname]g your own custom made solution from the ground up (for my project I'm opting for a custom made from the ground up solution). I'd be curious if creating the add-ons ends up working well for this project. I'm sure myself and the whole OMSCS student body would love to see this project succeed so we can have a single place to go and find all of these extra resources specifically intended for students so I send my best wishes to you and the team!"	9/15/2015 0:33	776		
Student94	Student29	1	It is a great concept to find a playful way of teaching computer science concepts. That certainly will help with retention. In terms of curriculum you can just take any intro level computer science class and look at the syllabus and spin off of that. Identify those concepts that you could easily teach with MinecraftEdu and go from there	9/15/2015 9:23	681	5	
Student94	Student60	1	I think you are designing a tool to be used for project group formation. It is not clear this is a research or a design project until the last paragraph. You may want to discuss why the current way of forming groups is not effective.	9/15/2015 9:34	927	6	Gives the insight to what is missing in my submission.

Student8	Student80	1	"I would like to see where this goes. This has definitely been a problem in my experience. While this may not be a truth, my experience also shows that there are people who are willing to do so much work that they basically render others as freeloaders. So I am not sure how that would skew things but in general I have definitely experienced the person who doesn't contribute anything."	9/15/2015 9:50	297

Student8	Student17	1	"I think one of the things that I dislike about our current system, is having things in different places. For instance, have SOME instructions in one location and then other instructions in other places. This has caused me to not get an A because I didn't type in four sentences that basically would have said, ""This scene is at my work. I stood in one location and turned around 360 degrees. The other scene is also at my work. Here I slowly walked through an trail behind my office walking towards a pond. The path had many turns. However it seems that some of those turns and the pictures I took caused it to not allow for a longer photosynth."" And if I would have said that, I would have gotten an A, but because I didn't I got 20 points off on one assignment that I didn't get an A. The issue was that there were instructions and I followed those.. but they hid instructions in a template that i didn't really look at because my understan[lastname]g was that it was a guide, not something that also had instructions. Overall something that can somehow eliminate that kind of silliness would be grand."	9/15/2015 12:01	313		
Student67	Student47	1	"Hi [lastname], I really like the problem you are trying to address. Regar[lastname]g the approaches, you mentioned there are advantages and disadvantages, but is there one you particularly would like to recommend in your classroom management program? or will the approach [lastname]es based on the situation? what about the strategies? The reason I bring this up is because in your program, teachers would like to see a �guide� or set of recommendations on what to do for different situations. Also, one thing that was not 100% clear is how the program will embed technology into the model. Is there a tool out there that maybe could give us a preview of what you are trying to achieve? Overall, great job on the proposal, and can�t wait to see what you come up with, good luck!"	9/15/2015 10:12	925		
Student67	Student55	1	"Hi, I really like the problem you are trying to address. Actually, some of the features you�ve described for omscs-advisor is something I�ve tried to put together myself very early on in the program (at the end of Spring 2014) since I noticed there was a lack of software to help me plan out my courses but even worst, a way for me to see which courses are good or not. The spreadsheet in Google+ was definitely of great help but feel, as like many in the program, that we are still missing that piece of software that can suggest and help plan out my studies, and really hope omscs-advisor can be the answer to that! I think you already got the right idea and since you are planning to build a web app, I would suggest buil[lastname]g out one feature first (such as the user profile & history) and provide a link on Piazza for others to test and give you suggestions on what to focus on next. In the end, this is something we will use, so it would be nice if could have a say on what we need or would like to see.

Student67	Student36	1	"Hi [firstname], I like the problem you are trying to solve. I do have a couple of concerns in term of how you will use the data gathered. In other words, if you noticed a specific tool does a great job in this area, based on your data, but this other tools does great in another area, then how can you determine the successful attribute of a tool if that tool could have many attributes combined and used at the same time? Maybe you already the part to analyze and made conclusions based on the data figured out or I could be misunderstan[lastname]g something completely :) Nonetheless, I would love to read what you find because this is something that could be extremely useful to tool developers out there (me being one of them).

Student67	Student4	1	"Hi, I like your mini project proposal and definitely see the value many students could poten[firstname]lly get from it. One thing that was not too obvious is what medium will be used to present your project. You mentioned, ""online platform"", so does this mean a web based program or mobile app? This decision is important when trying to decide how to best present these ""challenges"" to your users. Overall, I like the idea you are trying to implement and can't wait to see the final product!

Student1	Student61	1	Interesting idea. How would this be different from using a modern IDE that can suggest fixes for code and has syntax completion? Would you use actual students to test and see how effective the ITS is?	9/15/2015 15:48	331	6	Yes. I probably need to address explicitly how this will differ from IDE. I would love to test it with actual students but I doubt the time of the semester project will allow that. I suspect development will take almost all I have.
Student1	Student10	2	This is a really great idea! Have you thought about ad[lastname]g speech to text that could read the different tones?	9/15/2015 15:54	1679

Have you considered how you would address those in your project? Also, have you looked at code.org and other organizations trying to do the same thing?"	9/15/2015 16:22	387	6	Very good questions. I actually did look into code.org. This line of questioning does help me when I think about what to research.
Student43	Student13	2	"Nate, awesome assignment and it seems you have a good handle on what you're doing. Other than a couple formatting issues, I'm not sure how to improve this.

Student43	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	I think this is an area in need of definite improvement. It looks like you have a good idea of what you would like to accomplish.

Student101	Student35	2	"Very thorough and well presented! A little long for an elevator pitch, but perhaps it was a long elevator ride. Assignment well done! You appear to be locked on and know exactly what you need and how you are going to do it. Good luck!"	9/15/2015 18:41	4276		
Student101	Student76	2	"This sounds like a fun project. I got into rea[lastname]g up on the Kinect, thanks to your paper, and I find it to be a fascinating piece of technology. What you are proposing to do utilizing the Kinect is very interesting, not to mention the capabilities of this technology and what it can do. I watched a youtube video by a team from USC on their ""SimSensei"" and ""MultiSense"", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2aBJ6LjzMw . Using facial recognition to help tutor by a machine is quite the concept. I do not know if this will help but here is a URL to that USC's project, if you do not already have it: http://ict.usc.edu/prototypes/simsensei/ . Motivated and dedicated! Look forward to seeing what you come up with."	9/15/2015 21:18	2763	6	
Student101	Student82	2	"You followed instructions precisely and I feel this is a prime example of an elevator pitch. If I was on the receiving end of your pitch I would most definitely be having a follow up meeting with you. I really liked your timetable and breakdown showing your schedule. I believe that when you show people graphically when and what you will be doing whatever it is, they have a tendency to be more accepting or at the least have a better understan[lastname]g. I went over the PDF from the developing team at the University of Toronto on Skip-Thought Vectors. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06726v1.pdf . Their work is quite impressive, and if you will be incorporating some of this into your project I would love to see your final result. Best of luck!"	9/16/2015 9:34	734	5	Thanks Josh. I'll definitely include a diagram or two in my final proposal.
Student101	Student34	1	"I believe that Peer Feedback is an effective pedagogical tool, and is one of the best means of learning I have experienced so far this semester. In my honest opinion, anything that can be contributed to help make the learning experience better, I say, do it. Your plan of attack sounds right on, one area that did stick out to me that may affect the results (which you do mention), is that awar[lastname]g extra credit for participating. If such a study would be conducted you would need a neutral playing ground, thereby provi[lastname]g more accurate statistics. I also love your idea of fin[lastname]g out more on the students and their backgrounds. Knowledge is power, if more is known about an individual, a more complete understan[lastname]g is established which leads to a successful learning experience. Great job! I cannot wait to see what becomes of your idea. Good luck!"	9/16/2015 15:44	2638

Student84	Student95	1	"I like your overall idea and every writeup you've done starting with assignment 1.. I can see that you are passionate about what you're going to make and I very much very much hope you're wrong when you said kids don't make things anymore. I remember the years of tearing out my old toys for the electronic components and re using the little gears for odd stuff that almost 90% of the time didn't work. And that's really what's lead me to where I am. I have a 3.5 year old son and I hope what you said isn't true. I definitely think what you're planning to make is going to help (especially those kids who don't have the parents who are interested in these technologies). I think I can only make one suggestion to add value. When it comes to creating the instructions and training material make sure you cover a wide spectrum of teaching methods. For example, when it came to following instructions make sure you have it with AND without images. Make sure you include little side notes about why this is connected to that AND keep it short and quick for the ones that really just want the thing to work first then they'll figure out how it works. Also last but not least, the major problem with robots and wheels is that it's not too attractive to girls that are in 6 7 or 8th grade. There may be a small number of girls in your class but if you could find out what else you could design that would attract girls of that age that are interested engaged as well. Good luck"	9/15/2015 22:14	1634	1	Thanks for your comments. I had not really thought about what would make the robot more attractive to girls. I will have to ask some of my girl students... perhaps a survey to my last years class could give me some incite into their perspective.
Student84	Student43	1	"I think it's a good idea. You wrote: ""though I have much experience as a user of many games built on the Unity engine, I have not done much as a user of Unity itself. I expect there will be a learning curve but hopefully not too steep"" To tell you the truth this would make me very scared of undertaking a project of this scale. Maybe by your next proposal you should try and wet your feet a little bit and see how much of the project you think you can do and then cut that in half and do that piece only. I have zero experience with game design and Unity, so you definitely could be right. But if I'm not the only one mentioning this then you should maybe re-evaluate your project scope."	9/15/2015 22:42	506	6	
Student84	Student15	1	Interesting and complex proposal. I can't add anything of value. But I can tell you that your mini-proposal makes my mini-proposal look like notes on a napkin. Good luck and I look forward to to see what the interface will look like.	9/15/2015 22:50	251		
Student84	Student40	1	I would advise against using any sort of dynamic front end that has to use a database of any type. Especially for faculty pages that really doesn't [lastname]e that often. But they do [lastname]e some here and there and need to be updated preferably by the faculty him/herself (So I see the reason). But I think if you could make your application output static html pages it would save a lot of resources and give you more flexibility to use that engine on other projects as well. Jekyll is a good example but extensive. https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll . I think making your application this way would prove to be a good choice in the long run. Good luck.	9/15/2015 22:54	845		
Student86	Student99	1	This is a great and interesting research topic of fin[lastname]g plagiarism based on the same authors previously submitted content. This could be challenging because there would be many cases of false positives as the students might deliver different assignments/projects with various qualities from time to time. Have you done research if any tools already available to do the same?	9/16/2015 9:53	4861		
Student86	Student45	1	"This is a neat tool. I look forward to seeing this tool in the upcoming semester and being used widely by new and existing students.

Student81	Student37	1	This is a very interesting idea. I think there is a big need for this solution. I suggest that you focus on solving current challenges with these types of systems that already exist. 1) Information is unmanageable and does not usually contain tags that allow me as a contributor to focus only on the things I know about. This class and Piazza is a perfect example of too much information to realistically look at everything. I did for the first 2 weeks and then it was too much to keep up with so I perform a visual filter by topic and hope that the topic description is accurate and the thread does not go off too much of a tangent. I just can't keep up with all of the posts and if this were expanded to a large company or entire university - it quickly becomes unmanageable. 2) Searching for a topic or area you wish to do research on is unwieldy in the current systems. it would be nice to have a Google type search capability	9/16/2015 13:36	451		
Student81	Student94	1	Good references and strong ini[firstname]l document search. Seems a little abstract . Have you considered how meta-cognition plays a role. How will technology really be used? Maybe that is the primary research question.	9/16/2015 13:44	667		
Student81	Student63	1	Consider the scope of this project and how it relates to what subject matter that will be taught and how that general system lends itself to teaching more than one subject. Consider the age and education level of the student. How does this affect the AI?	9/16/2015 13:56	303		
Student81	Student29	1	There are a lot of open ended questions. its a great start but there is a lot of work to do between now and the full proposal. remember to consider how exactly you will make that big leap fom Minecraft type environment to a MinecraftEdu module that facilitates learning.	9/16/2015 14:01	276	6

If DD is caught early enough and an appropriate intervention is developed, then it could be reversed in time. There is one particular research done during the course of one month that shows improvement. This was measured not only by improved performance, but by scans of the brain."
Student12	Student85	1	"I agree that technology needs to take center stage in education. Especially with the teacher-to-student ratio, technology can provide resources to students that teachers may not have the opportunity to provide. With technology in the front, students can search for any missing gaps they have with their lecture instead of waiting for the teacher or if their too shy to ask. Technology can also provide videos and demonstrations of concepts that may not be at the teachers' disposal. There is a cost for moving technology to the front of education but I also feel it's necessary to ensure success of students."	9/16/2015 16:33	453	5

Student41	Student101	1	"The subject matter you're confronting, helping teachers become more technically savvy, is a worthwhile topic. For your research, i think it will be important to qualify what skills you're measuring. The example you gave was an instructor who doesn't know how to upload a file. This, to me, implies that the instructor cannot navigate the file system. So, these are the types of competencies that I believe you would need to map for your research. That begins by asking, ""What technical competencies should an instructor possess?"" This might vary greatly based on what the teacher teaches. So, maybe there is a core set of competencies that all instructors should possess. I was thinking that it would be pretty cool if your research was based on the application of these competencies. For instance, don't send a survey. Send an assessment (http://online-shc.com/clt/q1.php) that gauges their computer skills proficiency. That might help inform you of the areas where instructors need the most assistance. Good luck with your project."	9/16/2015 19:12	959	7	
Student41	Student16	1	"This made me wonder: Does Common Core include material with spaced repetition in mind? If not, it would be interesting to see a matrix that spans the grades yet covers a discreet topic. Language learning or mathematics would probably be good subjects for this matrix. Or were topics not designed to span grades? When I've used language learning tools, like Duolingo, I've found that the spaced repetition aspect of the material to be quite helpful. I think the notion of ""scaffol[lastname]g"" is also important here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffol[lastname]g). Not only is a learner revisiting already learned material with this theory, but they're enhancing the learning by buil[lastname]g upon it. By doing so, their mastery of the older content is assured. This is why I questioned whether your SR would span multiple grades. A high school student shouldn't need to revisit basic arithmetic concepts, because they have been buil[lastname]g upon to concepts with more advanced concepts. Therefore, by mastering the more advanced concepts, they continue to demonstrate proficiency with the simpler concepts. When I was poking around the web, I found this paper to make a lot of salient points: http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition Good luck with your project!"	9/16/2015 19:28	2211	6	
Student41	Student42	2	"Very interesting subject matter. My question is, ""Is it just hearing the vocabulary or is it interacting with another person?"" If interaction is one of the key benefits, I wonder if Pre-K children wouldn't benefit from a ""Turing Test"" type of application. If children were able to converse with a tablet and have that application build their vocabulary, would they arrive in Kindergarten more prepared to be successful in class. I kind of wonder, though, how much a child's success in school is related to hearing more words. My guy reaction is that there's an element of care and affection that comes into play. Think about a wealthier child with a stay-at-home mom and a poorer child who gets dropped off at an affordable daycare (with a low adult-child ratio). The wealthier child is going to have almost constant attention while the poorer child will get less attention that's sporadically focused. In fact, the latter child might only get attention once they've done something ""wrong"" (diaper [lastname]e, acting out, etc.). So, even if the poorer child was sat down in front of Sesame Street all day or a tablet that talked to him/her (let's say they heard just as much conversation as the wealthier child), would they succeed at the same rate as the wealthier child? Not to get too psychological, but it feels like the attention of an adult is an important component in this equation and I'm not certain that a technological solution would level the playing field. Would it help, though? Almost certainly. Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there. It's really a fascinating subject. However you project turns out, I wish you luck producing it."	9/16/2015 20:05	1542		
Student41	Student2	1	"Excellent analysis of how smartphones have been miscast as educational tools. Yes, it's fine to watch lectures on them, but, you're absolutely right, it's their ubiquity that makes them invaluable. My question to you is this, how do you make the microlearning so discreet that it would be valuable to spend 30 seconds using it? That is to say, ""What about meteor could you condense down to 30 seconds and maintain the learning value?"" Learning built-in classes or methods? Co[lastname]g a concept into reality (https://www.co[lastname]game.com/)? I would guess that there are concepts or activities that can be compressed into tiny chunks, but the challenge might be identifying the material can can be broken down and then actually creating the 3-second lesson plans. Or, maybe you ask the learner how much time they have to spend: 30 seconds 1-2 minutes 3-6 minutes ...and then build materials accor[lastname]gly. Personally, I use my short bursts of time on my phone to play quick games (Words With Friends), but I would actually prefer to be spen[lastname]g that time learning or [lastname]forcing my existing knowledge.

I am not sure if individualized feedback is in the scope of your project but we can eventually reach there based on your framework. I feel this project will be a great addition to edu tech community. All the best."	9/17/2015 14:00	625	6	"Here are some of the steps we hope to cover in terms of producing individualized feedback: (1) for project submission, we intend to give the instructor ability to write custom feedback for everything that gets tested, similar to how udacity shows feedback. This will allow more personal guidance for single project. (2) We have some nice-to-have features which include taking data across multiple projects and deriving information from that, inclu[lastname]g viewing student's development over time and possibly what areas they are struggling with as individuals/as a group in whole. I think the real value of individualized feedback can be derived from looking at the submissions as a whole and over time. If we can determine such analytics, it could also be visible to the student; there's a world of opportunity here."
Student60	Student98	1	"I really liked the idea. I too feel that we should provide as much support to underprivileged as much we can. Your idea of dashboard is good, though I wanted to know if your dashboard is build upon the assumption that someone will feed the data into the DB and your dashboard will mine the data and display it? If thats the case, how sure are you on data availability? Other then that I liked the idea and I look forward for your project."	9/17/2015 14:10	551	6	"The feedback was helpful and pointed out future discussion topics for future assignments. The questions 1) Will someone feed the data into the DB and your dashboard will mine the data and display it? If that's the case, how sure are you on data availability? The reviewer pointed out room for improvement that would make for great project results."
Student60	Student50	1	"Hi [firstname], I had read your previous submissions. As I am working in one particular problem of MOOC and trying to provide a solution for the problem: Group Formation. Anyway, I like your idea and topic of research. I will love to see the set of question which you have to categorize students. That itself will be really helpful. I feel your research will add a lot of value to edu tech domain. Looking forward to your research. All the best."	9/17/2015 14:19	692		
Student7	Student88	1	"Using data visualization to improve online courses is a good idea. I think it is wise to leverage edX as much as possible so you don't have to build from scratch. Will you provide any (automated) interpretation of the visualizations? For example, maybe if you calculated a visualization like the first diagram in your paper, you could give feedback like ""Your course assessments are very linear. Perhaps you could add new types of questions or give feedback to students on some questions."" This type of feedback might give instructors an action to take to improve their course."	9/17/2015 11:34	381		
Student7	Student46	1	"You have a very well-developed idea for your game. You have a good set of goals for what you want each level and type of game play to [lastname]force. Do you know what technology/language you will use to create the game? A lot of the concepts you described sound like they might be a good fit for a mobile, touch-based interface. If you are doing a mobile game, you may be interested in SpriteKit (https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/), SceneKit (https://developer.apple.com/scenekit/), or some of Apple's other technologies for games on iOS."	9/17/2015 11:41	659	7	
Student7	Student86	1	"I think your idea is very important. Giving a good introduction to programming to students at a young age could have a high impact on the student's life. I think you will also learn a lot about curriculum design and how students begin learning a technical topic. You might be interested in the journal article ""Designing for deeper learning in a blended computer science course for middle school students"" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08993408.2015.1033142 - I was able to get the full text through the GT library for free). I found that article when I was doing research for my own project."	9/17/2015 11:52	630		
Student7	Student45	1	"In the past I have wished I had more information about some classes I was considering. I think your project address that need and will help give prospective students an idea of what to expect. Will you be working with course instructors to create the quizzes and exercises, or will your team be writing the exercises? Do you plan on releasing your tool for all the existing OMSCS courses, or will you concentrate on a few courses to start, and expand later?"	9/17/2015 12:02	323		
Student3	Student19	1	"Best of luck in this endeavor. Since the inception of the ""Hour of Code"" by Code.org two years ago, fin[lastname]g a Computer Science programs is as easy as searching for a Flashlight app on your smartphone. The difficult part, however, is determining if the CS content is of quality or not and worth investing school hours in. As a K-12 IT Director that has directly assisted in the Hour of Code adoption, I highly recommend investigating Code.org's platform based on your proposal. In terms of accessibility, they provide a clear example of how a web-based / game-centric CS program may be implemented. Aimed at K-12, they somewhat solve the ""log-in"" process for younger K-5 learners. However, even for Kindergarten and 1st grade, it sometimes takes 20 minutes to get all the kids signed in! Are you going to have users login? If not, how will you keep track of progress? More importantly, at my school, the School Leader, Curriculum Specialist and I are still researching how to better incorporate CS into the overall subject agenda. Per your introduction in this Mini-Proposal, yes, CS is marginalized from the remaining curriculum. However, I believe that if CS is to truly take hold in K-12 education, it has to be INCORPORATED into all subjects; not specifically be identified as a stand-alone curriculum. For schools with mobile technology in the classroom, this is definitely feasbile. Setting aside ""Co[lastname]g Time"" at school has not been effective. For example, during a Math lesson, we have students perform even the most basic calculations in Microsoft Excel utilizing function f(x) logic. i.e. something like =((Cell A1 * Cell B2) / Cell C3). Does that make sense?? I like your idea. Just be sure to not be another Game-Based CS platform. Don't limit your idea to a game either; everything we find is a game and we are looking for something more than ""tricking"" our kids into learning. Don't get me wrong, game-based learning has its benefits, but having a professional platform for CS Learning is ideal. Maybe create something that incorporates infuses Social Studies, Math, or English with Computer Science! We have done a ton of research on this and cannot find any results; just games! If you do, let me know! If you would like further feedback as you progress, feel free to email me at: Student3"	9/17/2015 12:12	2481	7	This has been the most helpful feedback I have received since the course started. I cannot express how much I appreciate Luca's time and dedication on his response.
Student3	Student96	1	"Hello, I believe I provided feedback on Assignment 2 or 3 for you previously. Anyways, I am having a hard time understan[lastname]g how your platform will be better than the other existing thousands of communities. Will there be zero-accounts-whatsoever or are you referring to not requiring an account to view content? I am interested in how easy-accessable-content will be your key [firstname]eting approach. Do you plan to only cater to Web Developers or use that audience as an ini[firstname]l population to expand upon? As an IT Professional, I am a member of the IT community Spiceworks which appears to have a similar objective to yours: A.) http://www.spiceworks.com/ B.) http://community.spiceworks.com/ Is this similar to what you had in mind? Good luck!"	9/17/2015 13:26	907	6	
Student3	Student28	1	"The more I read this paper, the more it appeared to be a BuzzPort tool; a tool that the college would manage. In your mentioning of ongoing Management, keeping track of professor and class [lastname]es sounds like an administrative duty and not necessarily a students. However, this wouldn't be sufficient if the tool accommodates Pre-Program Assessments (non-students don't have BuzzPort obviously). Do you fully envision this to be a student-operated tool? To utilize Unofficial Course Surveys, the tool might have to be a separate entity from the college itself in order to gain truthful insight. I find it interesting that you may include Graduation Preparation. With this inclusion, the tool then includes not only Academic Tools but ""Student Life"" / non-Course related tools as well. In my opinion, Course Pairing sounds very beneficial. For example, should Programming a Robotic Car be taken in conjunction with KBAI? I look forward to following this project."	9/17/2015 13:42	2322	6	
Student3	Student53	0	"I believe a key factor left out in this proposal is overall User Interface Design. I understand the objective to have the agent gauge user proficiency. Instead of investing in usability agents, why not invest in a better UI design? So, in your final proposal, maybe indicate that the agent will sit on top of an already thoroughly tested design. If you were selling this agent as a product that could be ""injected"" into a working program, you could [firstname]et that your agent could ultimately make the program even more user-friendly. A pitfall here is thinking that you can train the average user to make them better at utilizing a product. That is a daunting task and somewhat unfeasible scenario for any software company. I am not a UI Developer, but my immediate assumption is to always assume that the average user is inherently non-tech savvy (I have an IT background). On a scale of 1 to 10, how can you make your 1's productive with minimal training?"	9/17/2015 14:26	2393		
Student33	Student12	2	"I love your idea and I think you have taken a realistic approach to project expectations. Actually this was one of my secondary ideas. Essen[firstname]lly what I thought about was creating an application that would allow students that took courses whether they dropped it, passed it or struggled in it to provide feedback and input that would identify the skillsets needed to complete the course. I think that you are very close with your idea. I think one of the ideas that I had that you may want to have is to compartmentalize it into aspects inclu[lastname]g *Weekly hours to devote to the course *Programming skillsets,(python, java etc.) The actual programming concepts such as stacking and so forth. But I definitely think you are realistic as you mention the time commitment that it cannot be completed in one semester. I am looking forward to see how this project comes together and as everyone knows the ini[firstname]l software architecture is the most important part of the design process."	9/17/2015 14:36	59		
Student33	Student85	2	"[firstname], I think what you have here is a well defined and excellent idea. I think we have some very similar thoughts on how educational technology can be used in the classroom. I am particularly biased because my project will be focused on how educational tech can be utilized to help bridge the technological gap in low-income schools. One of the topics that I will address is the need to better prepare teachers through training provided with the use of ed tech and also using ed tech to reach students in these disadvantaged background in ways that traditional methods have failed them. These are both points that you have mentioned in your proposal to a certain extent so I see your thought process. The only thing that I think you may want to mention is your research techniques and how you plan on going about evaluating the data. Will it be mainly quantitative or qualitative and what programs do you see in place that you can refer to that shown success. If I come across articles that will help you I will definitely be sure to share this with you. Great job!!"	9/17/2015 14:37	76	5	
Student33	Student30	1	Ned I like how you expounded on what was identified as short falls of your assignment 2 to give the background information first and then led into the Project proposal. I agree with you hat your focus on the pitch would have to be a little more specific and I see that you are cognizant of this as you have addressed it when you wrote that you may want to pair it down to maybe a niche area. I think that will help you for this project since it will help you to focus on a particular area for this project and set realistic expectations for project completion in this semester.	9/17/2015 14:39	24		
Student33	Student56	1	"I think this is a cool project. So what is your proposal for evaluating the Stealth Assessment data for this project ? Will you also evaluate some sort of qualitative data. Will this evaluations just focus on SAT or will it encompass MCAT, GMAT or is this just for High Schools."	9/18/2015 20:35	444		
Student74	Student18	1	"Very interesting idea! It is one of those simple implementations that may have a great impact on online education. Are you planning on developing the tool only, or will you perform some research as to the effect of the tool on students and educators? I am asking only because I am currently TAing another class, and there seems to be some obvious frustration with one of the projects. It would be great to know what the research says, or even help you if you need a group to do some research on! (provided the instructor is ok with this)."	9/17/2015 21:06	295	5	
Student74	Student59	1	"Interesting concept. Have you researched if there are any tools already doing something similar in the [firstname]et? Perhaps that can give you some insight on good things they do to carry them onto your solution, clunky things they do to avoid, and some absolutely missed opportunities for novel features! The thematic appropriateness engine really captured my attention. How are you planning on implementing it? I imagine a dictionary of ""bad words"" would be straightforward, but one can also definitely be ""adult"" without using any bad words. That's very intriguing! I'm looking forward to rea[lastname]g more about your project. Good luck!"	9/17/2015 21:11	363	7	
Student74	Student11	1	"The project idea definitely sparked my interest, but due to its brevity I am not sure I completely understand how it is supposed to work and be implemented. I believe the paper may have benefited from a little bit more detail, to not leave us hanging, asking for more!"	9/17/2015 21:17	154		
Student74	Student52	1	"Interesting topic, though I am not sure exactly what will be the process followed in your research, if there aren't any ITSs that can track what you need. Do you all have an ITS you can adapt to record emotional feedback? Or does the project involve the creation of an ITS that can do that? This last one sounds like such a tremendous effort on its own! It it is the former, recognizing emotion in the tone of voice sounds fascinating, but a lot of work. It might be a good idea to have a clear focus on what needs to be developed to do this research before embarking on it. I imagine you may have already explained this research in previous papers, though. If so, please disregard my comment. Overall, this is a very interesting topic. It really sounds futuristic, promising and exciting. Good luck!"	9/17/2015 21:20	532	7

While I have no experience in this area, I looked around for some resources that might trigger some inspiration for designing the games. http://www.kansasasd.com/socialnarratives.php I saw that you would be using 6 students with autism and different �skin tones�. Not to criticize at all but you might want to consider using �race� instead? Looking forward to hearing more about your project and how it turns out. Good luck!"	9/18/2015 0:17	47

Teachers can share their online lessons with other teachers in the system? This would replace the need of having to going to an external site like https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/ to share their lessons, it can all be done in your proposed LMS system.

Student25	Student22	1	"Your proposal is really focused on teaching Computer Science more efficiently at the middle-school and high-school level. Sounds very reasonable and I agree with your challenges. I would also add, delivering the programming environment. Installing a Java IDE on a wide range of devices and workstations could cause issues for the instructors. My project focuses on creating virtual workstations preloaded with the software needed for the course so the educators and students can jump right in on Day 1.

Student26	Student59	1	"Hello [firstname]. I think you presented the problem well and it is clear what problem you are trying to solve. While in the OMSCS I have come to appreciate AI to a large extent and I see where you are headed with your proposed solution. While I find the solution absolutely fascinating, my concern is that natural language processing is a very difficult problem to get right. Therefore, I see two different pathways you might want to consider: (i) If you are really interested solving the specific problem presented, abandon the NLP approach and opt for a human-driven rating and review platform, where teachers and other interested parties could contribute and add their inputs. I think long term this will lead to higher quality content. (ii) go for the NLP approach, because if you can get it right, there would be more use cases here that the solution could solve e.g. for libraries: doing automatic classification for their entire collections; news providers: automatically classifying news articles and fee[lastname]g content to people based on their reader preferences; book retailers inventory management, etc. etc. The NLP is definitely ambitions and perhaps more rewar[lastname]g if you can do it. I look forward to rea[lastname]g more about this later."	9/18/2015 9:16	1103	7	Interesting feedback that definitely has me thinking carefully about my current approach.
Student26	epennington3@gatech.edu	1	"Hello [firstname], the tutoring agent is a very interesting idea. If I'm understan[lastname]g correctly you are taking the idea one step up from KBAI in trying to figure out what reasoning approach the student is using in solving raven's matrices; and using raven's matrices to do accomplish that determination. If so I can't wait to see the end result, that is very fascinating and ambitious. One thing your proposal reminded me of remotely was a couple of exams I took during my undergrad (e.g. COMPASS) where the computer would present question (A). Then, depen[lastname]g on how I answered, I would next get either question (B) or (C) or (D) ... not really sure how many levels there were, but the point was my experience as a student [lastname]ed depen[lastname]g on the previous actions I had taken. I don't know if you have looked into these systems and how they work but they might be helpful as a resource when you plan how the tutor should operate."	9/18/2015 17:08	816

Maybe it will be helpful or give you some ideas. Here is a link to full article: http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191178-sensing-emotions/fulltext Besides that I thought your topic was interesting. I would recommend you refine your focus a bit because you started by discussing issues international online students might be facing, but I feel what you proposed solution could be applicable to online students as a whole. So I would maybe think either (i) how are international students different and what factors affect their learning outcomes, and if you had some specific nationalities or cultural regions in mind narrow down to those; -OR- (ii) how do emotive factors affect learning outcomes of online students. These certainly overlap but right now I got the sense you were wanting to answer both questions (or you started with one idea which lead to another and I just read it incorrectly). Anyway, please take a look at the article. I thought the authors approach was very creative and may give you ideas."	9/18/2015 17:22	1738	5	
Student26	Student74	2	"Hello [firstname]. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your paper. You writing was very well organized, clear and had a good sense of progress. I also thought your brief summary of what you had done in the previous weeks and how that lead you to where you are now was excellent. First let me comment on the choice of technology you are planning to use -- You should consider using xamarin (if you have not considered it yet) for the mobile app, because it's cross-platform. You would only need one code base and it can run on multiple different devices inclu[lastname]g iPad and Android. As a GA Tech student you get the dev environment for free. Of course this is not necessary I just thought I would recommend it as it might save you lots of future effort if your app becomes hugely popular. Alternatively you could consider mobile-friendly HTML5 solution and just wrap that in an iPad app, because it would allow you to publish updates and port to other platforms very easily. The video modeling was an interesting approach to teaching. I had not personally heard of video modeling before, but you explained it very well and I think it's a great idea to have some examples and suggestions in the app to aid the process of creating one. As I read through the assignment, I thought your list of features was quite extensive given the time frame, but I think if you are able to get the team around it you should be able to get most of the features done. One thing I thought of as maybe a future helpful feature, is if there was some way for educators to share the videos so that not all users would have to create their own from scratch."	9/18/2015 17:51	1537	6	
Student36	Student95	2	"Great paper organization and topic information. I would try to work on your flow from sentence to sentence, it will keep the reader more engaged in your idea.

Student36	Student55	1	"Your mini proposal seems short. Expand on your ideas! I couldn't easily match up the requiremed sections to your document. Define sections to get some response clarity! Your idea is really great, but there isn't much to evaluate with the document length so short. The future assignments will require a lot more words, challenge yourself to expand on your ideas."	9/18/2015 19:45	140		
Student36	Student4	2	Very well organized proposal. Much better than the others I have read. The use of tables and visual aids is good. I would add alternating color rows so the table is easier to read. I would also request for more text explanation. Some of the upcoming assignments will have much longer word requirements and will require idea expansion at a greater level.	9/18/2015 19:48	104	7	
Student36	Student84	1	"This is organized fairly well, but it seems like half the paper is questions to answer. This is good, but what metrics are standard for these kinds of questions, and what specific metrics would you use in your upcoming research. Expand on your example, as you will apply it in the upcoming assignments."	9/18/2015 19:49	110	2	Half the paper would look like questions if the reader hasn't read the line lea[lastname]g up and following it. Questions that have answers given are points that stress on different areas. Expan[lastname]g on my example would be a bad idea since it's not really my product. It's an example within another [firstname]et. Note to self: It behooves me to ignore this feedback.
Student20	Student22	2	"It seems like you have a lot of experience with teaching computer science topics at the corporate level, and as a corporate employee who has taken such courses, I can definitely relate to your material delivery points.

Student96	Student45	1	"This seems like a very good project. I really look forward to seeing it come together because it could help figure out what courses to take next. (or I hope that it can help figure out what next.) Ideas: - It would be helpful to track what courses I have taken and maybe even what I thought of them. Then it could help plan what courses to take in the future to meet a certain concentration/specialization. For example, I put together a Word doc with the ones I have taken and narrowed it down to a few. Then I can figure out what courses to take that fill the requirements. - I also really enjoyed the spreadsheet on Google+ that lets people rate the amount of time to take each course and what they thought of them. It would be so cool if this could even group people together so I could tell if the folks that thought AOS was hard and took 10 hours/week (like me) would think of another course...or ones that took a survey and rate their Python Strong but C weak. Good luck!"	9/18/2015 22:12	316	1	This is the best feedback I have received till now. The first idea will really distinguish us from all the tools available out in the [firstname]et.

Student96	Student7	1	"I would love to take your course. Many years ago I bought a Mac and got a developer account and made a serious effort to learn iOS development. I bought two books and did every exercise in one. It was all very graphical and I got the samples to work but never made the jump to designing things from scratch. Keep in mind, I consider myself a pretty good C programmer and know several other languages. I complained to a friend that does iOS professionally and he said I was doing in ways that were too time consuming and he would never do. He also came from a C background and does most of his UI work in code (which I wished I could do to make interactive UI features). It discouraged me to go down one path and realize that there was a whole other world of working with the code. This was back when iOS was young. Though I would have loved to get a perspective on different ways of developing for the platform."	9/18/2015 22:17	484		
Student96	Student46	1	"Very cool! I like the idea of the buckets. Learning different bases is tricky and I could see this helping even an expert programmer to ""think"" in other systems. I especially like that you scaled down the game to something specific. There is only so much time in a semester and I'm feeling overwhelmed by getting it all done. It's inspiring to put together a plan that's workable in the time allotted."	9/18/2015 22:25	161	7

I remember rea[lastname]g recently that computer programming is going to be mandatory in some region (CA or some other state) by a year not far off (2020?). It makes me wonder if there are meetings being held places to decide what the students should learn. You could both learn or contribute to any of these ini[firstname]tives. Second, it makes me really curious if any of the automated code testing like on Udacity could be used to gather feedback on what is working. In other words, give assignments and let a computer gather information about what is working for them.

Student47	Student4	1	"Very well thought out. I know a lot of other folks in the class are also studying some similiar area, it would be worthwhile to connect and ex[lastname]e ideas. Hopefully some of the people giving you peer feedback are these folks too."	9/18/2015 23:50	482		
Student47	Student84	1	"Interesting concept! With glassdoor, the posters either really like it (so they want to promote the company) or they really hate it (so people will stay away from the company). It is not a random sample of people. How might that affect the outcome in your system? What is the incentive for parents to submit data about their child?"	9/18/2015 23:58	397	6	Good point about not so random sample of people. Very good insightful questions. Short feedback but I benefited from it more than many other longer feedback submissions.
Student70	Student71	1	"Hi [firstname], I really liked the way you wrote your proposal, it was really easy to read and understand. I think your project is interesting and doable, probably there are some tools out there that are doing something similar but still yours can be better or it can contain some more learning scena[lastname]. I am wondering if just the ""student app"" would be enough, at least at the beginning, with preloaded default training materials. I think the ""take a quiz"" option is promising, to measure improvements and probably recommend other training materials. Looking forward to download this app!"	9/18/2015 23:22	1391	6	
Student70	Student51	1	"Hi [firstname], this is a great topic! probably one of the best things about your project is that it is very well targeted, which gives you a clear idea of what exactly do you need. Another important thing I really liked is the modularized design, because with some minor [lastname]es or module replacements you can make this project serve different purposes. I don't think it is an easy project, but if you are able to deliver module by module you can achieve what you want. I really look forward to see the final app, good luck!"	9/19/2015 10:41	5300		
Student70	Student39	1	"Hi [firstname]y, I think your project sounds doable in the short term and in fact may contribute to the learning process. I still have some questions like where are you going to host this Lab? how do you add more labs to it, is it going to be a ""self-service"" approach? are you going to validate the user creden[firstname]ls to access the materials? Looking forward for the implementation, good luck!"	9/19/2015 12:09	1415		
Student70	Student6	1	"Hi [firstname], I do agree that workplace training is very important and often it is short of necessary points or too boring and time consuming. It seems that your approach is very targeted for "" Varian Medical Systems"" which is good, but I am wondering if there is a way to make a more gen[firstname] solution that can serve a wider audience. Because as I mentioned before, the workplace training is a problem in the whole industry. So far I haven't heard a person that is happy of going to this tedious process. Good luck with the implementation!"	9/19/2015 12:37	476	5	"This is the same concern that I had, that my proposal may be too specific to my employer. But I believe that the enhancements that I will be implementing will be gen[firstname] enough to be useful in a general case, not just for Varian."
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student11	1	"Short and to the point. Sounds like a really interesting project. I don't know if this is possible, but it would be interesting if this could be tied into a Piazza as well. Since we already have a central discussion area for the courses, it would be nice to be able to aggregate information through this back into the regular forums as well. Both for posterity and for multiple forms of information retrieval. I would have liked to see some more information on the analytics you plan on performing, although I realize this is just the mini-proposal so you might not have that worked out yet. I like the idea and look forward to seeing more of it soon!"	9/18/2015 22:48	5108		
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student59	1	"This sounds like a fantastic idea. I have a handful of friends who are teachers and they would probably love something like this. One thing you might want to consider is allowing a way for a user to send in a classification correction. That way if lets say a book excerpt with particularly well written prose accidentally gets classified as poetry, the teacher who notices the misclassification can flag the entry for review. I suppose that's not something you'll need to worry about quite yet if you are mainly focusing on the classification algorithm(s), but still something to keep in mind for later. I look forward to seeing what you come up with!"	9/19/2015 17:16	443	6	
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student18	1	"I definitely like the idea of something that can aggregate this kind of emotional data and provide it to instructors. I'm uncertain how this data could be used in cases of conflict though. My guess (and obviously I could be totally wrong on this) is that for any given subject, problem, etc, there will be a wide distribution of emotion experienced among the students, in many cases directly conflicting. For example, how should the instructor proceed if it's determined that half the class is ""puzzled"" while the other half is ""enlightened""? What helps one half of the class may hurt the other half. I suppose the real answer to this is that the instructor should use the data to experiment and iterate. Just something you might want to keep in mind while you develop the algorithms and tools to gather the data though. Good luck!"	9/19/2015 17:24	1516	4	
epennington3@gatech.edu	Student74	1	"I really like the concept. It seems well thought through and I'm interested to see the final version. Oddly enough, I think this project would actually go hand in hand with the research one of the other current student's is doing. By dumb luck I happened to peer review his proposal right before this one. :-P Student18 is doing research into gathering emotional data from students that instructors can use to help judge the effectiveness of their teaching methods. It might be worth talking to him, or at least looking up some research in that space, in order to incorporate that in a way that might help determine the effectiveness of the script that an instructor is using in your app. Just some food for thought. Good luck on your project!"	9/19/2015 18:11	351	6	
Student91	Student44	1	"Hello [firstname], I like all the set o resources and the interesting facts you have compiled here. This study could be a good source for students looking for good apps, as well as for developers like us, who era looking for ways to provide a much more richer education experience to students. I wish you the best for achieving your objectives."	9/19/2015 0:06	1242		
Student91	Student67	1	"Hello [firstname], I understand you are Peruvian from the introductions thread, I am glad to give peer feedback to another Peruvian like me, I lived and studied school in Cusco, and after it I moved To Guadalajara, Mexico to study University. I share your motivation to try to help motivate student in the same way we are motivated to take advantage of online courses. I think is a matter to give a try to your idea, but I have a question. How you may do to incorporate in your app the fact that students should be capable enough of achieving things? You may need to compile information on many subjects to prepare by yourself some easy to solve questions and problems, or your app will do it in some automatic or semiautomatic way? or maybe you plan that information to be growing with the time? That would be an important aspect for me, if I were to build this system. I also want to share with you my project idea that is also an app that may engage the students in a better and more efficient study/remember/review, that ultimately can have the effect of motivating more to the students. The definition of my project idea is a follows: A �Student MOOC Learning Assistant� will help me easily and quickly remember and/or review previous learned material from a MOOC Course, for a deeper understan[lastname]g of the concepts, for preparing myself for an Exam, or for preparing myself for a future Project or Course. It will take into account my previous memorized behavior of study, that I myself will help the application to construct, in a semi-automatic and dynamic way, when viewing the course Lectures and other course resources. This would be similar as when a student takes notes while studying,. This will make the learning process and the application of the learned materials much more efficient, saving valuable time, and, indeed, making the final objective much more reachable. If you want to contact me my e-mail is Student91. Good luck with your project."	9/19/2015 1:07	12		
Student91	Student47	1	"Hello [lastname], I think this application could help the instructor to not let it pass inadvertently any disruptive behavior that could damage the learning process of the students. In this regard you are right it can help a lot, even preventing problems before they happen and this way strengthen the right student attitudes. I believe integrating this app with other study supportive apps may help as well. Good luck with your project."	9/19/2015 17:13	1094		
Student91	Student36	1	"Hello [firstname], I think the idea is good and if well done it can provide interesting and useful information and suggestions. I Just think that may be the scope of all the proposed work may be a little big for a semester class, specially if you plan to to continue evaluating the educational platform [lastname]es based on previously found possible improvements. Just a thought. Good luck with your work."	9/19/2015 17:31	3366	5	
Student52	Student75	1	"Hi [firstname], Great mini-proposal and explanation of the approach you plan to take to accomplish the pre-registration system! I agree that a system like this could provide added value to the OMS program to allow students to be better prepared for the classes they plan to enroll in next, while also assisting faculty with predictive data that can help them ramp up for their courses in terms of enrollment capacity and hiring of TA's. Two questions that came to mind while rea[lastname]g your paper are the following: 1) You mentioned under Assumptions that part-time students can only take a max of 2 courses per semester, but will this pre-registration process limit students to only pre-register for 2 courses as well? It seemed like the registration process for this fall semester experienced issues with students requesting to be waitlisted for more courses than they were allowed to take. This scenario reminded me of dead-lock in Computer Science where we were all waiting to get into a class, but no classes were available. :) Also, after completing 2 foundational courses, students can enroll in up to 3 classes per semester if you would like to consider that in your project. I don't know that this information is made publicly available on the OMS website, but Mimi from GT mentioned it in an email before- ""If you are allowed to register for up to 9 hours (have met the foundational course requirements and are fully admitted), then you may ONLY request 9 hours of overloads (three classes)."" 2) What type of server or hosting service to you plan to use to run the pre-registration system? Are you considering a cloud-computing service like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure? Great progress so far and I look forward to hearing more about your project!"	9/19/2015 11:28	1140	5	1. number of courses and others param can be configured and easy to [lastname]e on UAT stage. 2. I am thinking for the Spring based MVC framework and LP engine on the backend for optimization like GLPK or Gurobi. Thanks!
Student52	Student100	1	"Hi [firstname], Great mini-proposal write-up and pitch! The logo mockup really added a realistic value to the proposal, plus I like the name. I was really surprised to read that there aren�t any other solutions like this that are publically available yet. This project sounds both interesting from the development perspective and exciting in that you plan to make it open source so that others can use it and make contributions as well. Not to mention, this project will hopefully add value and increase productivity for your Web design class. I think integrating a solution like this with an LMS, such as D2L, is a great idea. I see that as an opportunity for easier adoption among other instructors to use for similar classes. Your proposal sounds spot-on and I look forward to hearing more about this project."	9/19/2015 11:47	815		
Student52	Student32	1	"Hi [firstname], Your project proposal sounds very interesting and like a fun project to work on, especially considering the opportunity to incorporate the AI frames you mentioned. I�m not too familiar with Question Banks and their use, but I was curious about your project and whether the data in the banks could be easily imported and exported. It seems like this approach could poten[firstname]lly allow for quick manipulation of the data and/or sharing it with others. If the Questions Banks or tools used with them already exist, then please disregard that question. I think you�re off to a great start and this mini-proposal certainly shows that. I look forward to hearing more about this project later in the class."	9/19/2015 12:01	601		
Student52	Student83	1	"Hi Mike, I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your mini-proposal. It felt genuine and the idea is unique from any other project that I�ve read about so far in this course. I�m certainly drawn to this project as well from the intelligent tutoring perspective since that�s the path I�m pursuing in this course. The layout of your proposal was well done and concise. I think a solution like this could make a big impact on young lives and how they approach problems throughout life. With preparation like this, students will have an advantage to solve and/or tackle problems in school, real-life situations, and work. I often view employment as an opportunity to be hired by an employer to solve one or more problems that they�re facing, whether it be an engineering firm to build complex solutions or even as a teacher to find ways to help students learn. I hope to hear more about this project later in the course. Good luck!"	9/19/2015 12:11	799

Student63	Student60	2	"The author is interested in study group formation in MOOC. As some of the students in this class, I doubt the outcome of doing a project with a group of people whom I am not familiar with. I really need to know how much time they are willing to spend on the project and do we have the same expectation on the quality of outcome. So I choose to do my project on my own. I think this proposal may increase the number of students to form a group online."	9/19/2015 13:26	1138	7	I liked the explanation in the feedback. A bit inspiring too.
Student19	Student7	1	"I like that you have a detailed process plan outlined. That will help you a lot in narrowing your focus and provides attainable milestones. One thing to consider is maintenance. Technology moves really fast and a couple of months is all it takes to render information obsolete. It will be good to consider how will you maintain the resource updated. Also think about competitors, a good example is Treehouse. They offer an iOS track which is very comprehensive, of course this is not free. I like your idea, and would like seeing where you go with it."	9/19/2015 15:01	719		
Student19	Student53	1	"Very interesting idea. I like the structure of your proposal. One thing that would be important to focus on, is how do you plan to motivate users to look at the training material? For example, some software might offer me a pop-up with information on how to use the system better, but all I see is a pop-up that is disrupting my work and immediately close it. This would be a very useful tool indeed. I would like to see what you come up with at the end of this course!"	9/19/2015 15:28	125		
Student19	Student28	2	"This is amazing! I would be very much inclined to use such tool. Your proposal seems very detailed and well structured. I can relate to the pain and confusion of not knowing what to expect from a class. One thing you can consider for maintenance is using an architecture similar to Wikipedia, so content/resources can be edited by students or professors without any overhead. This is something you can do after you have built a solid enough user base, so ini[firstname]lly it will be closed editing to make sure the content is valid and up-to-date. GitHub Pages is fantastic for static content, but if you need some background processing you can also try Heroku, which offers a free tier. Although, once you have a lot of traffic you will need something more powerful, so consider having a plan to accept contributions from users to cover costs of a better hosting instance. Awesome work, I can't wait to see the final product. Feel free to reach out if any feedback is needed: Student19 ."	9/19/2015 15:30	712	7	Great to have a poten[firstname]l user and content contributor!
Student19	Student96	1	"I looks like you are very passionate about researching the topic. I like how you have an outline of small objectives that will help you finalize the project. I will say thought, that it wasn't clear to me what exactly a ""Community of Practice"" is and what are the ideals it encompasses. Readers can use the citations of the book to get background knowledge on the topic but I think it would be good to provide a definition and a small summary of the ideals that you will be comparing against. Note, this might be something you have already done on previous assignments and I'm just lacking that context."	9/19/2015 15:42	556	6	
Student49	Student92	1	"I like the idea, you may want to look into gamification elements, incentives, and maybe development with a responsive web design so it is easily viewable on mobile devices. Another thing to think about is the competition and if there are any current frameworks available to be built upon. I had a similar project proposal and incorporated embedded virtual machines from a cloud cluster and clientless remote access via HTML5, this also may be something you'd want to look into."	9/19/2015 15:20	255

I have interviewed and worked with many within my organization. I understand and commend your efforts here. I was lucky to get a lot of hands-on technical courses throughout high school, but noticed as I went into my college years the instructors focused more on abstract concepts and theory. I encounter a lot of folks who struggle with the application of college taught concepts and theory because they had never had extensive hands-on experience. The ability to inspire passion in STEM and teach theory paired with hands-on experience is what makes a great CS teacher. Good luck with your deep dive into this research!"	9/19/2015 15:25	850		
Student49	Student38	1	"Sounds like a solid plan you have here. Since you are looking into developing in Java have you looked into modifying MOSS directly? It sounded like you were going to build a completely separate system, it appears the code for MOSS is available in java in github. https://github.com/nordicway/moji this was pulled from the MOSS official site. Not sure if you have analyzed the feasibility of that or not, but leverage what you can. Good luck on your project!"	9/19/2015 15:39	643		
Student49	Misc3	1	"Excellent idea, automation is something that is in dire need throughout many businesses. Eliminate all manual processes! As for your project, perhaps look into gamification elements, incentives, efficient conveyance of knowledge via suspense/chunking, and perhaps research how to keep your students engaged.

Student42	Student34	1	"It seems as if your experiment is designed well to determine if there's a positive correlation between participating in peer feedback and student performance in CS6505. I'm curious if there was some relevant research that led you to focus on peer feedback as a mechanism for increasing student performance in massively online courses? It certainly makes sense in the context of being scalable, but I wonder if there was more than that fact to make it a compelling target for research? Also, you mention that students who are willing to the extra work required by peer feedback will likely not be completely aligned with their peers in terms of motivation, time etc., but it also occurred to me that students who are motivated by the extra credit to participate might also be those who are skewing to the left gradewise, which could impact results."	9/19/2015 15:28	1078	6	
Student42	Student2	2	"I love this idea, especially the mobile portion. How great would it be to have a quiz bank for a class like networking or information science where you could brush [lastname]force rea[lastname]gs and lectures in a few minutes at a time?

Student42	Student76	1	"This sounds like it would be a truly impactful project, and I'd be interested to see the end product. I've read before that digital cameras/software can do quite a bit to track attention based upon eye movement, mostly used in the context of recor[lastname]g and analyzing the performance of teen drivers. Is this something similar to what you'd be doing, and are the algorithms for mapping this kind of physical movement to emotion/attention widely available or would you have to implement this from scratch? How are you planning on establishing your case basis for implementing your case-based reasoning?"	9/19/2015 19:53	575		
Student42	Student101	1	"I'm ultimately not real clear on exactly what question your research would be addressing or exactly what your approach is going to be to solving it. Are you targeting the OMSCS program specifically, and are you seeking to help professors understand Udacity? TSquare? Some combination of the above? Is there an epidemic of ineffectiveness in teaching in the OMSCS that you're seeking to address that you've attributed to lack of understan[lastname]g of the technology as a whole? I understand you may have explored some of this more in depth in your previous assignments as well, but those are the kinds of things I think it would be valuable to address specifically as you continue to work on your proposal, etc."	9/19/2015 20:02	593	7	
Student39	Student6	1	"I like the idea of education technology being applied in the professional world. I like that you found a tool that you would like build upon, giving you the option to improve what's already in the field.

Student39	Student51	1	"I like the idea of video modeling. That's how I learned how to tie a tie! One thing I would suggest it not limit yourself to just an iPad. Web applications have the ability to do video recor[lastname]g now and could be accessed via Android and Microsoft tablets. Your walkthrough of modules is good and provides a lot of non-technical detail to show how it would work.

Student39	Student71	1	"I like the idea. I am not sure it's entirely necessary to be a native application. The functionality mentioned would also be fine for a web application or even a hybrid that is built with web technology ported to native code. That way, you application has a wider release than just an iOS - which can be more expensive. The application in question does sound similar to Udacity. I wonder if leveraging existing platforms for unintended targets would be better than recreating the wheel."	9/19/2015 16:24	345	6	"As we build out the app and as we find success in iOS, it would definitely be beneficial to expand to other os platforms. We will need to develop with that in mind."

Student50	Student18	2	"[firstname] - this is fascinating! It's amazing to think what might be possible someday if this took a step beyond self-reported emotional states and relied on brain-computer interfacing (or some other kind of neuroimaging). Paired with an intelligent tutoring system, you could have dynamically-scaled, individualistic learning. It'd be great! But, well...giving up that degree of mental privacy may be a tough sell for most. In our current cultural state, what you're proposing is much more palatable, and would, I imagine, but incredibly helpful to many educators. With what frequency, do you think, would a typically educator would poll his students for emotional feedback? Is this a once-a-week status check? Daily? Multiple times per class? What factors might come to influence data under each of those options? In any case, great work! You've included lots of interesting information in here, and I'd be curious to see where this leads!"	9/19/2015 17:26	1956	5	
Student50	Student26	1	"Great - this is definitely relevant to some of the scaling problems MOOCs (and OMS) face. A couple of thoughts - 1. How much flexibility would instructors have in defining stages 2 and 3 - intrinsic issues and project-specific criteria? Would the goal be to tune the solution finely enough to remove subjectivity in evaluation? What degree of setup involvement would be required from the targeted end-user? 2. Is there room for evaluation error? What�s an /acceptable/ level of error? What subtleties of evaluation do you lose by using this tool, and what criteria would you use to evaluate whether or not the positive outcomes of the solution out[firstname]gh those losses? In any case, nice job! There'll likely be lots of details to iron out with this undertaking, but it seems like you've consensus about where to focus the bulk of your efforts. Good luck!"	9/19/2015 17:58	1434	7	"to answer these points, (1) we will include some checks that will always run; there are non-graded tests but we will display the information to the instructor if we find such issues. We want to do this because some situations are edge-cases and not necessarily relevant to the instructor to define explicitly every time they set up an assignment, none the less they should be made aware if some edge-case issue was discovered. Beyond that instructor will have great flexibility in terms of how they want to set up their assignment and what things to test for. Since the test runner doesn't care who submitted the assignment it will be subjective evaluation for sure. (2) to handle error, we will have options to manually overwrite autogra[lastname]g results. The final say is always by the instructor. I wouldn't say we necessarily lose any subtleties because this is not supposed to be start-to-end automatic evaluation process. We are automating the steps that are suitable for automation. I suppose if the instructor wanted everything to run automatically for something like MOOC, they could by pass manual evaluation and just rely on code correctness, not human factors like ease of use."

Student34	Student78	1	"I like the way that you represented your plan in a flow chart, it makes it easier to see how things are intended to work out. I also like the idea of students being able to give feedback on their current frustration level. I'm sure the ultimate goal for a lot of systems is to pick up that kind of thing automatically, but that's a pretty huge task in itself. A quick tap that indicates whether you're bored, happy, or hitting their limit for the lesson."	9/19/2015 20:07	214

Student34	Student35	1	"I think it'd be worth putting some more attention on what poten[firstname]l attempts to game the system would look like, since people could obviously adjust their efforts to maximize the number of pull requests and such they make, rather than trying to optimize actual contributions."	9/19/2015 20:20	233

Student77	Student53	1	"I think this idea is a good one, but it seems rather non-specific. Teaching a user how to use Facebook is much different from teaching them to use Google Drive, for example. Per product, onboar[lastname]g a user is something that Product Managers, CEOs, VPs of Product and technical leads think of on a daily basis. I guess I'm unclear on what your proposed solution is: do you adhoc learn someone else's system and then adopt your platform to help onboard their users?

Student77	Student3	1	"So a bit about my background/perspective: I worked as a Product Manager of a small tech product called Coder while I was at Google. Our mission was to reach middle school and high school aged kids with this raspberry-pi-based experience to ignite their interest in CS. One of the major obstacles we faced was in our curriculum: not in the design of it (there were tons of hands-on projects, things to build, etc) but in the execution by the school's teachers. If the classroom was lucky enough to have a teacher with some sort of CS background, troubleshooting issues that came up (things as simple as Wifi access) would not be blockers for the entire program. But more times than not, simple things like that would cause the entire curriculum to halt because there weren't people able to assist in the implementation or troubleshooting. I'd recommend taking a look at what technical resources (or lack there of) are in the typical k-12 classroom and how those might cause obstacles in simply han[lastname]g off a curriculum to a school district."	9/19/2015 20:21	331	5	"To address the recommendation offered: If there are technical resources for teachers on campus, it is a campus that is lucky enough to have an IT admin. If not, they must rely on other tech savvy users. In short, this owuld fall under Pillar Item #2: Proper Teacher PD."

I believe this to be a nice outline that has poten[firstname]l to address the problem and solution, but I wasn't expecting an outline. Also, it isn't clear to me what you are looking into.

If this was more of a tutoring system, I can see that being a useful to an extent. I'm not convinced that knowledge recall is helped when augmented by a student assistant. It is not 100% clear to me what you are proposing. I'd like to see your idea better refined and some references to support your claim. And as this is a mini-proposal and not the actual proposal, I believe room for refinement is implied in this assignment. I applaud your effort and look forward to what you deliver. Also worth noting: I found this article which has some additional concepts that may be relevant to your project such as an AI ""learning companion system"". This may or may not be closer to what you are attempting to describe in your mini-proposal. http://chan.lst.ncu.edu.tw/publications/2003-Chou-rtl.pdf Good luck!"	9/19/2015 20:55	621	7

Student56	Student90	2	"I think this is an excellent project idea. It is interesting to me because you are touching slightly on combining technology not only with education, but also with the therapies. I also think that you did a great job of narrowing down your project scope to a significant, yet attainable deliverable. One question I had, though - is the ability to memorize the multiplication tables severely affected by DD? Isn't it just rote memorization, with very little mathematical aptitude necessary?"	9/19/2015 22:39	214		
Student56	Student21	1	"Fantastic idea! I think your project could truly benefit the OMCS program. That said, you could only design the pages for classes that you've already taken.

Student13	Student63	1	"I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your paper Yi-Chen. In terms of feedback, I will admit that there were a few places where I was a little confused on the direction you wanted to take. I am also curious about some assertions that you made. For example, you note that: ""However, the current game based learning is lacking of the effective feedback like traditional ITS"". Can you provide some exapmles to back this up? Or, is there any support for your assertion? This will be something that you need critically in your paper even if it is obvious! The other thing that I would note, is to be careful making generalizations. Giving my perspective based on publishing. For example, you note that: ""With the assistance of the visual help, it has been proofed to improve student�s engagement during the lecture."" Do you have any examples? What references do you have to support this? Again, just want you to be aware so that you really nail those pieces down! In terms of the procedure that you developed, I did have a question. Where did you get it from? Or, is this your conception? There is clear logic here, and I would encourage you to cite or back up where things are working from. Also, I am curious. Do you agree with those procedures if they come from a research source? Do the order of the steps impact how effective a game is? Lots of things I am just generally curious around and would encourage you to explore! Finally, I like your described design and the detail. For these, I am curious as always on the rationale. There were a few places where the writing got me confused and I would encourage you to polish thing. For example, you said: ""Here I would like to learn from the PHET a free resource simulator. In PHET, it is more like an online experiment. student can adjust the parameter to see what will happen."" What specifically would you like to learn from PHET? What parameters would you like to adjust? All in all you did great work. If you can polish the writing in some cases and your ideas, and dig deep, you will be in perfect shape!"	9/19/2015 23:55	926		
Student13	Student37	1	"Thanks for much for your submission. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your work. I enjoyed your ini[firstname]l points re siloing and the prpoblem that you wanted to solve. As a researcher, I know that one of the things one has to do in a research paper is support their arguments. This is going to be my focus here in terms of the critique. For example, how do you know that large corporates typically suffer from the problem of silo isolation? Is there any literature backing that up? Is it a personal feeling? Are there situational factors? Generalizations that aren't supported can often cause you issues, and I would encourage you to close those gaps during your future work. For example, you mention that ""older corporations have a much harder time inspiring innovation among their employees"". Is that always true and are there examples? I ask as I teach in an MBA program and know that there are many examples of older corporations adopting structures that make innovation thrive. Again, just encouraging you to close any gaps that you have! The next point to explore brings us to the solution. In this section you mention that the solution is to: ""Build a system that facilitates the formation and management of a problem solving team that reaches out across multiple business silos for problems and solutions."" How do you know this will work? And, is it a personal argument or have others come up with this? Also, has anyone tried to fix this issue before? If not, why not? I work also as a leader in a large company in addition to my teaching, and have seen different attempts to fix this problem. Again, am just really curious and want to push you to talk about the why! Also, in terms of the requirements, do you have any literature that talks about why the requirements may or may not work? For example, why are the things that you listed a MUST in this category? If, for example, I build a system that does not ""Provide organization to the team�s discussion of these problems and ideas"", does it mean that the designed system or solution cannot solve you problem? Again, am just probing, but would encourage you to take that critical view! Overall, I really enjoyed your work. Would just push you to go deeper. Ask yourself why things work the way they do, why a problem exists, and why a solution also exists! This may help you achieve the success that you are looking to achieve!

Mentorship is an important concept, and the examples that you showed support the use of mentorship as an active solution. The most exciting part for me is the fact that the research that you want to do will have a huge and important impact. Improving the U.S. Army's planning, coor[lastname]ation, and oversight is truly an excellent task. Overall, I note that you mentioned submitting a formal research proposal already to Microsoft. That said, as I got to the end of your report, I had a number of questions - with most focused on the why. I am sure that you will answer these. That said, I felt that I should raise there. When you talk about applicability, how will you investigate it? Are you going to use any specific measurement or criteria? How will you determine if it is the ""right tool""? Are there factors that you will explore or should explore? And, is there literature to support this exploration that has been done on other projects? I assume you will look at the technologies that already exist (as you noted). That said, what will you look at specifically in terms of those technologies? What about the key performance parameters? How will you validate prevoius [firstname]et research? Again, all questions I am curious about! The same line of thinking exists for efficacy. How will you conduct feasibility studies? How will you deal with opportunities and threats? Will you use qualitative or quantitative approaches? Also, what components will go into your high level cost matrix? Overall, I love the fact that you submitted this as a Microsoft Academic Research Request! I think you have an awewome subject, and am eager to see how it expands. If you need any insight or more feedback from a researcher who has done some work in this space, feel free to ping me. In the mean time, I look forward to watching your progress! Keep in touch!. Cheers! - Nate (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/20/2015 0:31	1640	7	"Nate, Thank you for the detailed response. I appreciate your comments and questions. Regar[lastname]g applicability, this will ideally be done through user evaluation and demonstration of the technology given a certain task. The real goal here is to perform a limited military proof of utility in which the technology is employed in a controlled environment and steps are taken to demonstrate or fail to demonstrate meeting capability gaps. For this particular research (CS6340) this approach will need to be flexible since the Microsoft technology may or may not be available. The measurement criteria will be more of a checklist as to success or failure to perform the task given the environment. During flight operations, we use a checklist to objectively record outcomes and this will strive to determine if this is the right tool . Those criteria or key performance parameters have not been fully identified. The factors to explore will also be developed more in the full proposal and more during the research. Regar[lastname]g literature supporting this type of project, Microsoft may have more information considering the technology is not released and has not been evaluated by the general population. Some of this part of the research will be speculative and conceptual or even virtual. KPPs are still under development and everything I have will be shared on my google drive. (http://bit.ly/CS6340-hololens). I have not looked at exactly how to validate the [firstname]et research but that is certainly something i will look into with more details. The feasibility studies will really focus on separating fact from (science) fiction and developing a return on investment model. The devil is in the details regar[lastname]g schedule, cost and resources which have not been fleshed out yet but you bring up great points that i will take to heart.

I absolutely can relate to your feelings regar[lastname]g information being everywhere! I like the list that you generated regar[lastname]g information sources. Also, I like your comment that information management systems exist that can help optimize information collection, organization, and retrieval. In terms of your solution I like your concept of buil[lastname]g a wiki like appication. I am also in a curious position as the person who started the Google+ OMSCS group. I have seen people try to create Wiki like solutions, but they have failed to take hold. Thus, I have some interesting questions that I look forward to having your group tackle. You note that wikis enable rapid and easy contributions direct to the web. What percentage of a population typically contribute to a wiki? And, would you not need a wiki manager to help push this along? Also, you note that ""Student can develop our own knowledge content, contribute to existing libraries, etc."" Do you have examples of cases where this has worked in the past at other institutions? I note that here for example students have a full opportunity to participate and can edit pretty much everything that exists - inclu[lastname]g the main information sheet. That said, hardly any do. Why do you think your solution will work? And what is it about a wiki that will make it better than the other solutions we are using. Also, how would your solution also replace the technlogies that you proposed ... or would it? Would you write integrations to Piazza? Google+? Facebook? What would you do? Currently we do some rough tagging on posts on Google+. Who will or how will these tags be maintainted? Who will maintain the categorization? I read the article from Heymann et all that you posted, and am curious what points you would take from tha tarticle which support the notion that tagging always guarantess the easy ""scaling and organization"" of information. Did the authors do any testing to verify their claims? If so, will you do the testing? In general I love the work that you guys are doing and look forward to supporting it. I am excited about the wiki concept though, from experience as a person managing the OMSCS portals, and also who has done this professionally at a number of other US colleges, I am not convinced yet that wiki's are the solution. For example, how do wiki's impact how the people in the community feel? The interaction? Does this [lastname]e the nature of the community? When I created the Google+ community, part of the goal was to help build a lasting online ""community"" which it has. Will this wiki also have that same impact? I look forward to collaborating, and would encourage your entire team to reach out should you want any help or more perspective!

I know this is a fairly abstract topic to explain; so it's hard to take something like that and turn it into a project.

You probably have already found some of these, but the good news is, if you know how to work with 3d models in your game engine, there are actually loads of sites where you can get free- or open-source models to use! (Many of them are of poor quality, but the great thing about a prototype is, the art doesn't have to be pretty - it just has to be recognizable.) http://archive3d.net/?category=429 has an OK collection of bottles and such. http://tf3dm.com/3d-models/food (scroll down past the first row of ""premium models"") has really nice-looking ones, but not many of them. And there are a bunch which I haven't looked through at http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-excellent-free-3d-model-websites/ (or just google for 'free 3d bottle model' and stuff like that). Can't wait to see what you make - happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/20/2015 6:26	553	7	
Student55	Student95	2	"Love this - you give a great picture of what you want to do, as well as the motivation for it. A little surprised at the mention of 3d printing and laser cutting - how will this work for schools that don't have those things? (I suppose you could offer pre-fabricated parts kits, or build an ex[lastname]e where they can partner with a school which *does* have the equipment - that latter one could be a project in and of itself, though.) Anyway, I still can't wait to see what you make, and I feel like it's becoming a little closer to reality each day. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/20/2015 6:36	303		
Student55	Student84	0	"This is a really neat idea! I feel as though some details are missing in order for me to fully understand what you envision, but the core idea of crowdsourcing data about developmental milestones could lead to interesting places. As it's been described so far, I'm not sure how it fits in as an educational tool. Are these specifically educational milestones (like rea[lastname]g ABCs, counting, etc.)? When a parent has an idea of where their child's development falls, what will they do with that information? Is it applicable to teaching them in some way, or suggesting interventions that might help a child who is developing late in some area? In the proposal, if you go forward in this area, make sure you explain the educational tie-in for this project, and how it solves an educational problem. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/20/2015 6:41	398		
Student55	Student4	1	"Impressive writeup - this feels like you've figured it out and are ready to go! It would be helpful to explicitly outline which parts of this platform are similar to existing co[lastname]g exercise platforms (e.g., SPOJ) and which are completely different. Looking at the description, I wasn't sure whether the main focus of your development would be content (e.g., a specific set of exercises for the course you describe), an exercise generator of some kind, the crossword puzzle interface, or something else entirely. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/20/2015 6:48	350		
Student80	Student73	1	"Consider the elevator concept discussed by Dr Joyner in the assignment prompt. It would be advantageous to really use that concept for the pitch. Although the assignment requirements are longer than an elevator pitch would allow, the exercise will still give you something useful. How would you state your project in one paragraph? I would flip this write-up around. Start by explaining that your solution is an automated advisor. Then support with details. Even if the pitch is ""We have to many nonintegrated student programs right now, so I'm doing a new automated advisor"", that will get your elevator audience thinking and asking questions."	9/20/2015 6:45	369		
Student80	Student72	0	"I'm not sure what your project is this semester. I know you plan to address the set of questions you raised, but how will you address them? With a survey? An application? An experiment? What will be the contents of the paper. What do you hope to prove or disprove? Consider the elevator pitch concept from the assignment prompt. Narrowing down your concept to basically a problem and a hypothetical solution, brief enough for the aforementioned elevator ride, which help clarify what you plan to accomplish, and it will prime the reader for details. It is possible that you don't have a clear picture of what you'll need to research. That's understandable. How can we know this early in the process? I sympathize. I hope my feedback provides some useful input on what to say when you pitch this to the Montessori educations whom you will ask for input."	9/19/2015 2:12	103572	5	
Student80	Student17	1	"The components of your project are scattered through the mini proposal, which requires that the reader piece them together. Consider putting those pieces into one short paragraph. The elevator pitch concept in the assignment prompt frames this approach. Although we need more detail to fulfill the assignment requirements, that brief pitch will be useful for explaining your plan. He is what I thought yours might be: A K-12 content creation system composed of videos and quizzes designed to facilitate teacher engagement. A brief statement like this can't capture the depth of your ideas, but by putting it at the top of the mini proposal, you get the reader's (or elevator audience member's) attention, and thence you can go into detail."	9/20/2015 6:59	432		
Student80	Student22	1	"It's not quite clear to me what your project is. Would you call it a lit review of middle and high school programming material with critique by domain expert in corporate education? How will this facilitate the goal of classroom success? Put another way, what is the problem you are trying to solve? What lack of success is there that your critique will address? The goals we were given from this assignment are somewhat contradictory. We're suppose to clarify our ideas in brief form, but the content of our problems is too large for the short space of an elevator pitch. Nonetheless, I think the exercise is useful, because if you can boil down your project to a few sentences, even if that loses some detail, the reader will understand your objective, and you can use the rest of the paper to clarify. In the case of this paper, I had some trouble tying the enumerations at the end of the document to the project. Perhaps if I had a better idea of what the end result will look like it would be more clear to me. Will the project result be an aggregate of many small critiques? You might discover an overarching theme as you do your research. That would be an interesting result!"	9/19/2015 2:13	104748		
Student92	Student93	2	This was a fascinating read. I suffer from narcolepsy and I was entirely surprised that there was so much academic research being done on the subject of modeling wakefulness. Good luck!	9/20/2015 7:14	148	6	I am not sure where he got the idea that so much is done in the modeling wakefulness. There is none
Student92	Student68	2	"Hey [firstname], I think that this research you are embarking upon is very important and I wish you the best of luck. I'm hoping the address this same issue in my own project from the software application side. I was taken aback by NYC's Mayor Deblasio when he announced that all New [lastname] City high schools would have to teach computer science within ten years. There are significant economic and governance issues that would really prevent this from working in the city's current state. I'm looking forward to rea[lastname]g your research."	9/20/2015 7:17	195		
Student92	Student38	2	"I took KBAI with Prof. Joyner last semester, and a number of students were caught cheating. This is likely going to be a huge problem in terms of scaling a MOOC program like Georgia Tech's so I think this will become even more important as education moves forward. If you haven't done so already, I would reach out to Prof. Joyner on his thoughts. If I remember correctly, he had access to an application developed for detecting plagarism and I recall, perhaps incorrectly, that another GaTech student created it. Best of luck!"	9/20/2015 7:20	244		
Student92	Misc3	1	"I think this is an excellent idea. I would love to see where your project goes. I'm curious as to any implementations ideas you have for this. I'm working on something somewhat similar, applied to computer programming. Automation is very industry-specific. I'm curious as to your thoughts about whether this makes it easier to teach because it doesn't require getting bogged down in implementation details, or more difficult because it's so purely conceptual."	9/20/2015 7:25	162		
Student98	Student74	1	"The paper did meet my expectations for the mini-proposal. The paper was well written and I understood what was going to be created and why. It will be interesting to see the final project. If the app every came to fruition, what would be some ways in which it would be advertised to serve the ASD community?"	9/20/2015 17:20	428		
Student98	Student50	1	The paper was well written and met my expectations for the mini proposal. It will be interesting to see the outcome of the final project. The problem paragraph could have been stronger by inclu[lastname]g some stats. Looking forward to how the research will improve the shared experience of all students in the educational environment.	9/20/2015 17:28	1110		
Student98	Student26	1	The paper was well written and met my expectations for the assignment. I like the lists provided throughout the paper. It makes the paper easy to read and understand. How faster would the tool be compared to manual gra[lastname]g? A scenario with statistics would have been desired to show the difference.	9/20/2015 18:08	1652	6	Good point but I don't have stats on that. I think I should suggest this to Dr. [lastname] so we can do some bench[firstname]ing.
Student98	epennington3@gatech.edu	1	This paper was very different than the other ones that I've read. How will the project [lastname]e the community? It will be interesting to see the outcome of the research at the end of the semester.	9/20/2015 23:57	8
