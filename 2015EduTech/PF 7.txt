Student82	Student32	2	"The inclusion of functional requirements, stretch goals and technologies makes it clear that team has given plenty of thought to what and how the project will be accomplished. The project timeline looks reasonable and it's great that each team member is already assigned tasks. Overall it's a great proposal and I can't wait to see SmarterAP!"	10/7/2015 22:25	200		
Student82	Student67	1	"The 1/5 is difficult to read. I suggest spelling out numbers numbers instead of using the numbers. For example, one-fifth instead 1/5. I love that the app will help to the see value in doing an activity. Other students in high school would get mad at me, but I'd regularly ask teachers in math what the practical application was of what we were learning. For some reason I do better when I can visualize how a mathematical formula can be used in real life. The project timeline would be easier to read if it was laid out from top to bottom rather than in landscape. Overall it sounds like a great project and I can't wait to see the end result!"	10/7/2015 22:29	279	5	
Student82	Student58	2	This is a great proposal. I only have minor suggestions for improvement. The first section begins on the same page as the table of contents instead of the next page. The formatting of the project schedule could be improved for readability. Consider uses tables or a Gantt chart.	10/8/2015 18:58	289		
Student82	Student77	2	I love how concise and precise this proposal is. Parse is a great tool. I used it in a team project for Intro to Health Informatics. I can't wait to see the final product.	10/8/2015 19:03	212		
Student40	Student49	1	"Hi Team (I'm not quite sure what name to refer to you guys by from the proposal), Overall, from a business perspective I really like the concept behind your proposal and would really be interested in seeing what the finished product will look like. While there seemed to be some confusion on my part between the heavy emphasis on the business side and the only occasional reference to education/students (which made it difficult for me to understand exactly how it might be used in an educational context), I really liked the idea more from the business context. Particularly because I was pondering such a system myself for my own staff earlier today (and to a lesser degree, these past few weeks) since I have a mixture of older staff, plus younger staff that isn't always highly motivated and looking to push into new areas and innovate (and since I have my own technical work I'm trying to do plus motivate and organize them as a team is a lot of extra work/time and it would be nice to have a way to increase that motivation naturally). One concern I would have is if it would be easy for these types of employees to ""get into"" using a system like this. One thing I tried at the beginning of the semester was I created a set of notebooks for my staff where they could list their weekly ""Goals and Accomplishments"". This idea stemmed from me wanting to learn more about the day-to-day major things that might be going on with each of my staff (to keep me in the loop and see where I might be able to assist) and also for them to set higher level goals to push the organization forward with additional innovative developments, etc. Then staff would turn those into me so I could review them and provide comments/feedback and even lend a hand where I could to assist them in making things happen. After several repeated announcements regar[lastname]g my wishes, I still only received one or two submissions a week (out of 6 staff members) and haven't continued to push them turning them in again (yet). Additionally though, even for the ones that were turning them in, they weren't really detailing much at all, and definitely weren't inclu[lastname]g much in the way of higher level goals in their notes (whereas in my case I was using my own copy of the same workbook and applying those same ideas to see if they would work for myself, and I felt they were, but I was actively participating in using the workbook...whereas in their case they might not feel the same way...I'm just concerned that the issue to be solved is actually more of a people/culture shift, rather than one than can be fully solved with software, but don't get me wrong...I still think it's something that's worth pursuing!). Good luck Team!"	10/7/2015 23:44	1405		
Student40	Student1	1	"Hi Sam, I think all of the factors you provided are great examples of poten[firstname]l stumbling points for students and it would be nice if there could be an online setup that was ideal (or could be made ideal) for each student. For myself, I've been struggling with the thought of quitting this program weekly this semester simply because my life feels out of control right now: work has gotten crazy in terms of my responsibilities completely shifting (it's par[firstname]lly rewar[lastname]g and fun to contribute/enhance another IT sub-department, but I'm also not doing much web application development anymore so that's a negative aspect), teaching part-time reduces my free time and ability to concentrate on this class, plus this class takes up more of my free time and takes me away from my family. So for me right now, the time situation is definitely an issue, but I also know if I don't pass this class (and raise my GPA) then I won't be able to continue in the program anyway. Motivation is another factor in the sense of I'm not always feeling like I'm learning much (this particular class' structure has been educational in the sense of what I'm learning from my classmates, which is cool, but I'm not sure if I'm learning enough things in a particularly cohesive way where I can take my learning and continue on with it, like I could if I were learning about a new technology, though now that we're getting into the actual implementation phase of this class maybe it'll be a bit more fun from that perspective and increase my motivation). Responsiveness from instructors and staff can definitely be a big demotivating factor for a student, but I feel at least in some ways Piazza is helpful in this regard because it typically does result in a fairly quick response from classmates (helping to remove that isolated feeling sometimes), but in the end, typically we still have to do the work ourselves so we can still feel isolated from that perspective (I definitely have felt like that a few times so far this semester, because it's not like I can hand off my day job responsibilities, the part-time teaching, and this class work over to someone else...it all falls on my shoulders and sometimes it's easier to consider dropping this class since I can't drop my day job and still feed my family, nor do I feel like I can just stop teaching part way through the semester since it will negatively impact all of those local students). I think the worst thing is simply the fact that dropping a class is a high risk decision for a program like this one, which is modeled after the typical university approach to class taking. For my Bachelors, I ended up taking classes online via AIU Online, and while it wasn't the best university per se, at the time I had a lot more free time so I could approach it as a full-time students and concentrate fully on my studies (something I wouldn't have the luxury of doing now anymore). One thing I liked about it though was the short class format (5 weeks for each class) so while it could be hectic and there weren't many breaks over the course of the program, I always felt like I was making progress in short spurts that way and I felt like I was knocking classes off of the list towards my degree and that gave me a sense of progress and momentum towards my goal of getting that Bachelors degree. With a regular semester schedule, particularly when I only feel I can sanely attempt one class per semester, that sense of progress/momentum is lost (I think I only feel like I have a little of that during the two summer classes I've taken so far in this program). Another approach to this would be the much more open schedule that Western Governor's University takes: http://www.wgu.edu/online_it_degrees/network_management_master_degree When my cousin mentioned he was going to get another Bachelors Degree in IT from this university I was curious to learn a little more about it and how it worked and I really appreciated the viewpoint they seemed to take with their programs: ""WGU is designed to let you go to school on your time, not accor[lastname]g to a class schedule. Our online degree program is flexible and puts you at the center of your education: you choose when and where to complete your coursework. Once you demonstrate your competency in a subject area, you can move on to your next course. Online learning is not easy. You should expect to work hard and spend 20 hours or more per week on your studies. Still, your program will be flexible enough to fit into your schedule, not the other way around."" I feel like having a program with more of that sort of flexibility built-in, where you can accelerate/decelerate your progress depen[lastname]g on your time schedule is a very attractive option and lowers the overall risk level for a student. I think typically the answer isn't that the student doesn't want to not finish a degree...I think they do, but more often than not, university programs simply aren't designed very well for real life and the struggles each particular student in an online program might be having throughout the course of a year or semester and simply can't provide the needed flexibility required to help make students as successful as possible. In my case, I really am interested in a Computer Science Masters personally because in the future (if I ever decided to get into teaching full-time at the college) teaching Computer Science courses would require a Masters in that field (I don't think a Masters in IT would cover the state's requirements) so that's kind of my rationale for choosing the OMSCS program (instead of something like the Western Governo's program linked to above), plus I simply want to learn more about being a better software developer. Hopefully this wasn't too long, but I hope your research goes well!"	10/8/2015 0:07	1679	7	Great feedback and good to hear about your experiences!
Student40	Student11	1	"Hi Vu, The Chrome extension overlay approach is an interesting one and I'm curious to see the extra information would be overlayed/associated with the main Udacity lectures. It'll be interesting to see how the program develops and what kind of traction it gets from all of the OMSCS students if it does everything mentioned above in the proposal :-). One thing that would be kind of nice is if the data/comments collected could be funneled into Piazza somehow too (essen[firstname]lly buil[lastname]g a direct integration between your extension and the Piazza page for the course and file the various comments as responses to individual threads that are automatically created for each video (so rather than storing information in Firebase it would be direct comments into Piazza for students), but there's some extra advantage to using a separate datastore such as Firebase too. Definitely curious to see how it comes together for you...good luck!"	10/8/2015 0:35	644		
Student40	Student74	1	"Very ambitious project :-)! First off, thanks for sharing the reference to the US Dept. of Labor ""Soft Skills to Pay the Bills"" program, seems like some material that could be useful for my institution (even though it's targeted for youth). I feel like the most important part will be the assisting with the storyboar[lastname]g process for parents or those creating the videos since that's probably going to be one of the more difficult portions for a person to develop...once that's in place the recor[lastname]g process hopefully be as time intensive. Definitely an ambitious project though, due to the poten[firstname]l time syncing, UI, video editing components, etc. that will be involved during the development phase...I hope it all goes smoothly though! Good luck in the coming weeks :-)!"	10/8/2015 0:46	3764

Student81	Student56	1	recommend that you narrow your focus a little. seems like you have some objectives that may not align or complement each other.

Student96	Student24	1	Great project! It seems like you are well on your way. I wish this tool was in place when I took SDP. At first the technology stack surprised me. I expected some sort of PHP/MySQL thing that's easily hosted. Though this just shows how little I know about using Java to build web apps. I'll explore some of the tools that you described in the technology stack. Good luck on the project.	10/8/2015 12:36	392	6	Thanks JW.

Student96	Student16	1	"Great idea! I have thought about that spaced repetition idea ever since rea[lastname]g a Wired article about something like it. I hope the project is going well. In case it's useful, I've had good luck with [lastname]trap. It seems to go well with the application framework that I built and sell. (and basically allows you to just think about HTMl snippets rather than responsive stuff.) I'm sure it would work with any back end technology you end up with."	10/8/2015 12:45	183	5	
Student96	Student42	1	This is a fun soun[lastname]g project. My first thought was that it would be a hardware solution where you'd have something like Amazon Echo that just sits and always records. Though it sounds like you have it all under control. Good luck!	10/8/2015 12:48	144		
Student43	Student25	1	"[firstname], this looks like an interesting and valuable project - very current in terms of current technology and approaches. No issues really jumped out at me and it looks like your scope is definitely feasible for this semester. Looking forward to seeing your presentation."	10/8/2015 13:03	1097		
Student43	Student26	2	"Very well done. Clear and concise. I'm not sure I have much to add for you but one question. I see you detail that the instructor would be responsible for defining the expectations. I may be wrong, but given the nature of HTML, will that be too restrictive? Is it possible for there to be multiple ways for the student to formulate the html, each which could be considered ""correct""? Will you account for that? I ask because I once worked on a CMS system for web content where we had to validate that the generated pages met certain output standards. We found that users would have multiple ways of writing their HTML so we were constantly updating our checks for coverage. One approach we eventually landed on was programmatically generating an image of the resulting page and comparing it to our ""master"" page image(s). If any pixels were off ""standard"", we could then dig further into what in the HTML caused the discrepancy. That may have no bearing here but it came to mind as I read your paper."	10/8/2015 15:19	984		
Student43	Student41	1	"I find this interesting from both an academic and corporate training standpoint. I had a could questions while rea[lastname]g this, though they may not impact your project. First, will the SMEs be compensated in some way, either based on ""time available"" or ""number of questions answered""? Will there be some way of throttling and/or load balancing messages to SMEs so they don't get overwhelmed with questions. If this is related to a specific course, could you invite students who finish the course (and did well) to become an SME?"	10/8/2015 16:55	1854		
Student43	Student68	1	"Quite the undertaking. I expect you all will learn some interesting insights through this. I'm particularly interested in this part: ""Effectively working with the bored, shy, disruptive or lost student."" All I can really say is be ready to quickly adjust your plan as unexpected issues come up, but it reads like you have some contingencies already built in. Good luck!"	10/8/2015 17:26	3717		
Student83	Student18	2	"This is an excellent proposal, and an interesting project. The research is very thorough and is presented well. That does lead to one question though - if the research supports reporting state along 3 axes, why is the tool only incorporating one? I understand the trade off with user acceptance and wanting the process to be as light[firstname]ght as possible, but I question whether having 3 rows of emoticons vs. just 1 is significant when compared to the overall time-cost of the process? Perhaps as a could-have goal, the survey administrator could select which metrics they want to evaluate? The implementation plan is well laid out and looks like it is set up for success. Great work."	10/8/2015 15:15	1512		
Student83	Student71	2	"I don't think I have much new feedback beyond what I had for the draft. This project looks well thought out, is clearly addressing an important need, and seems poised for success. Best of luck."	10/12/2015 13:24	1350	6	
Student83	Student4	1	Indeed provi[lastname]g students with more project based experience is a great idea as backed up by the research discussed. It would be neat to see some samples of the content that will be built in this project. Good luck with the implementation.	10/12/2015 13:48	1254		
Student83	Student65	1	The project is well described and the resulting tool sounds like it will meet a real need. Another stretch goal to consider would be a public database for questions that teachers could pull from and contribute to. Good luck with the implementation.	10/12/2015 14:46	19	6	
Student24	Student30	2	"Ned First of all let me congratulate you on showing courage to venture out into mostly uncharted territory in research. I am impressed with the depth of your understan[lastname]g and knowledge on topic. As others have mentioned the scope of the project is beyond this class and if you can continue with the research it might prove to be a substan[firstname]l thesis publication. From the perspective of proposal requirements, I think you have justified the need for the research and provided a solid foundation for anyone interested in continuing on. Judging from your sample page, It seems you are already on your way to implement phase I of your project. Stick with your vision, I think your project has great poten[firstname]l for growth."	10/8/2015 18:17	139	6	"Thank you, [firstname], for the encouragement and affirmation. Yes, I concur that the topic I have statked out is broad and poten[firstname]lly useful and that I intend to rise to the challenge and try to produce a deliverable of genuine value."
Student24	Student12	1	"Very well laid out proposal.I think lot of newcomers to OMSCS program can really benefit from this tool. Unlike any other major university, where all the course related information is readily available in one master application, OMSCS lacks such tool. Buzzport seems to consolidate most student related information but not many students frequently use it.Currently the data for OMSCS program is scattered around in 7 -8 different applications and unless one is aware where to look for it looses its value for provi[lastname]g any meaningful information. The schedule calendar looks very polished with clearly acheivable milestones. Overall good job on proposal."	10/8/2015 18:19	873

Student24	Student94	1	"Great topic and very thoroughly researched by the team. The paper does justify the need to look closely at emulating some of the success factors for Montessori form of education. I think the main reasons why Montessori education is so successful is because of hands on experience that it provides for children at that age, as your paper describes. Many theorists believe that children at that particular age, learn best through experiencing the real world objects of the 3-D world rather than through 2-D simulation of virtual reality. The belief is that any form of digital experience cannot replace hands-on real-time perceptions, however technology can be integrated into the system to complement their experiences. I think your paper does a great job of demonstrating the main reasons for the great success of Montessori form of education and how it can be emulated in traditional education to gain these benefits and make it more affordable to masses. As you identified ""kinesthetic and sensorial"" elements are key to successful integration of technology based on Montessori teaching techniques. The set of questionnaire is well thought out, but I do believe to add authenticity to the research, the involvement of children will provide better results to compare."	10/10/2015 9:11	842		
Student9	Student29	1	"Seems a shame not to publish the results - I'd reconsider the IRB just in case the data turns out to be interesting - you never know what you might find. Particularly if you are going to go through all the effort of running a class. It will be an impressive amount of work. It seems to me, the benefits of in person school is living and breathing with people who are working on the same projects. E.g. going to lunch with classmates, water-cooler discussions, etc. Do you think that will happen with your courses? Also, will it NOT happen with online students (e.g. ,will you select them so that they do not know each other beforehand?) I'm very excited to read the results! Great work."	10/8/2015 22:13	406		
Student9	Student37	1	"Looks like a solid problem - The one piece I feel is a bit lacking is how this problem couldn't be solved with a forum, or a Stack Ex[lastname]e like system. Why couldn't such a tool be built on top of existing framework? Couldn't a proof of concept utilize existing tools, but incorporate the VM system? It's very possible that is too unpleasant - but some analysis as to why you've chosen not to pursue that line of investigation would be good. There are a lot of features here that don't seem to add much to the core of 'shared co[lastname]g space'. I think most of the focus really should be on iterating on the features that make this system unique from stack overflow - ad[lastname]g gamification and tagging later is well-defined, and not that interesting. Looks ambitious - good luck!"	10/8/2015 22:22	873		
Student9	Student72	1	I'd consider using Unity to build this - prototyping this game in Unity should only take a couple of days. I'd be interested to see the results of a large scale test. It would be interesting to compare between children with varied levels of computer exposure as well.	10/8/2015 22:37	279		
Student9	Student8	1	"Your central idea - that generalization can be taught through slight variation and repetition is very interesting. I like your approach as well. On the game design side, I have some feedback. Designing a game that teaches what you want it to teach is very difficult, in particular because part of the 'fun' of games is escaping the normal rules of life. Many children play GTA, but also know it is wrong to steal cars and shoot people - so the connection between game actions and real life learning is tenuous at best. Is this different for children with autism? Maybe? I don't know - but this would mean austistic children lack the ability to 'act in another frame of mind' - which, again, I'm uncertain of. Further, the arc of the game is structured so that power is gradually taken away from the player. This may in fact become frustrating. I'll think on this some more - but I wonder if there is a way to structure the game to teach the same lesson, but in a positive or challenging way instead."	10/9/2015 10:16	42		
Student90	Student67	0	"Your first sentence tells us that this app will assist people by recommen[lastname]g educational paths accor[lastname]g to the individual's interests and goals. This is a great concept. However, you do not show how this can be achieved. Actually you may be trying to [lastname]vent the wheel. There are assessments that achieve the objectives of your first sentence. I think you should be researching those assessments to see how to incorporate them on an app. The other issue I see is that if people are not interested in academic education why will they select to go to a [firstname]et place and search for this type of application. You did not consider that some people may quit high school and go to a trade. I think that, conceptually, your idea is very good.

Student10	Student75	1	"This seems like a really useful application of LP. I think that you will want to define your constraints better and really focus on getting them right - ILP for class scheduling is well understood, so I think that your choice of constraints is what is going to make or break this system. Consider, there are 2 classes, each with 1 spot left. A junior and a senior student want to take both of the classes. Does the senior student get both classes (and the junior get none)? Or do they each get one? You might also want to consider doing a hybrid system - do broad scheduling with ILP, but refine it with other mechanisms. One other question is how to avoid big [lastname]es when classes are [lastname]ed. When parameters are [lastname]ed, it can greatly [lastname]e the solution to a linear program. For example, if a full class has another 10 slots added to it, you don't want to reschedule all of the students again to different classes for the new solution to your linear program (which might happen with a general ILP problem). Then the question is though - who do you give these 10 spots to? And how does that propagate through the system? The other thing worth thinking about is who the different users for the system are (students, professors, TAs, etc.) and what value they will get out of the system, and then to build views for each of these classes of users so that they can usefully work with the system. Anyway though, I think that this is a really good idea. I think that you will find that the core of the problem is moderately straightforward, but that making it user friendly (for all of your types of users) is going to be where a lot of the real challenges are. Good luck!"	10/9/2015 11:41	1443		
Student10	Student9	1	"I think that you're taking a very reasoned approach to this - there's always the temptation to jump toward new technology, but it sounds like a big part of your effort will be proving your hypothesis, which is really good. Garris & Ahlers model seems like a really good starting point. I especially think that the ""mystery"" aspect is important, and that a lot of educational games miss that. Papers Please really seems like an interesting approach - I think that it's really hard to teach empathy, but that game at the very least seems to be a good starting point for it. I feel like a lot of people forget that there is someone else at the other end of a lot of interactions, and people working can forget that. Upwards of 20 hours to complete a game of Civ is VASTLY underestimating how addictive that game can be ;) One game that you might want to check out is http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/ - you build little DFAs to solve problems. I think it counts as an educational game (really fun too), and is one of my favorites. Anyway though - best of luck. I like your reasoned approach and I think something interesting will come out of it. One bit of advice I have is that you might want to formalize how you are analyzing these games - figure out what questions you are trying to answer (which in and of itself is a research problem) to make sure that you're getting the right things out of them. A lot of games have limited educational value, but are really fun, and so it can be tempting I think to ascribe more meaning to them simply because they are enjoyable."	10/9/2015 12:05	1639	6	
Student10	Student72	1	"Hi, I gave feedback on your draft, and a lot of the same feedback/questions stand. Overall, I think that you have to consider the scope of what you are trying to do - it's answering a lot of questions, and I think that the time horizon for this sort of thing is going to be long (I would think that studies on effective education techniques take years at the very least). I don't think that a 2-3 weeks of testing it with children is going to give you any meaningful data. So I think that you'll want to define something of lesser scope to learn for ini[firstname]l results."	10/9/2015 12:34	501		
Student10	Student8	1	"This sounds really good - autism is a pretty tough condition. I think that you understand the problem well, and have considered it from a number of angles. I really like the observation of games provi[lastname]g an environment that is safe from negative feedback (or at the very least, negative feedback can be controlled). On game assets, check out http://kenney.nl/ - he releases a bunch of awesome free art, that I think would work really well with your project. My question for you though is what you are measuring, and how are you going to measure it? I have no doubt that you can make a game, and that you can make it engaging, but how do you plan to at least get an early sense of whether it is helping, hurting or neither?"	10/9/2015 12:43	1608

Student54	Student77	1	"I like the idea of supplemental learning material. Having it aggregated and curated by TAs/Instructors into a single mobile app is something I personally would use but only if it was vetted and actively used by others. Interacting with other students by various methods is helpful but isn't my primary ""go to"" for information in regards to the classroom. As long as it is used by TAs, I think this could be beneficial to my own learning poten[firstname]l. As for your project proposal, I thought it was clear and well defined. However, I would have liked to have seen some supporting research in relation to your proposed solution. I suspect that there have been studies related to supplemental class resources, which may influence your MVP feature list choices. Here is a paper I found on Google Scholar that may be interesting for your project: http://placebasedlearning.pbworks.com/f/Squire_Mobile%2Bmedia%2Blearning%253A%2Bmultiplicities%2Bof%2Bplace.pdf You have an interesting project.

However, I fear that without proper checks in place, auto-gra[lastname]g essays without human involvement may be a deal breaker.

I believe that giving students a list of MOOCs available by subject mater is interesting and may be effective. However, doing more than just aggregating the available MOOCs should be the goal. I assume your app will augment a poten[firstname]l student's search for an applicable MOOC. However, what is the student's motivation for using your app as compared to learning about available MOOCs using EdX, Coursea, Udacity, or simply Google, etc. I imagine that the majority of MOOC creators assume that a user will consume the material using a standard browser, and not be primarily mobile. I also assume that the majority of students will search for MOOCs in the same manor. I'd like to see some studies both for an against your idea. Interesting problem.

I'm unfamiliar with JPlag, but glad to have been introduced to it here since my #1 beef with MOSS is that it is not open source. Followed by #2 painfully slow and #3 completely opaque in its results, and #4 for some reason it only finds 80% similarity in 100% byte-by-byte identical files. Anyway, I digress. I'll be very interested to see what you come up with to help with the filtering. I'm not thinking as well as I once did, but I'm not sure how you can get too far away from pair-wise comparison. I do know that storing pre-parsed indices for folder would likely help a lot, though I'd almost be tempted to just take JPlag and extend it to create a single, integrated system since you'd need much of the same logic to figure out which files to submit for ""real"" similarity testing.

Student100	Student53	0	"Overall a good idea. Certainly a noble effort. After rea[lastname]g this, I'm still not 100% certain what the application will do, though. Obviously it'll present vocabulary words with ""graphics, speech and text"", but it isn't fully clear how. Is it like a flashcard system? How do students respond (present word/choose definition, present definition/choose word, type word for definition, etc.)? If this is intended for touch, this might limit things in terms of the nature of the interface (i.e., really don't want to spend too much time typing in long words or definitions). Is speech just one way? Or can the system allow for students to respond with spoken word? How is it ""intelligent"" (presumably adaptive to the student's performance needs)? Is there a reporting system? Is it linked to the teacher/parent at all? Lot's left unanswered. On the technology side, have you considered using something like this: http://www.mircozeiss.com/buil[lastname]g-offline-applications-with-angularjs-and-pouchdb/ That would work offline (with online sync) and would support Cordova as well as a browser.

In my job I was able to show some instructors a few teaching techniques with technology that they were not even aware of - and vice versa so we both learned which was great! For example I learned to use a promethium board which has been around for a while but I never got a chance to use it - a great tool for the classroom. One item that you might want to consider is that students are still people and answer will technology make them learn faster or more? I myself am not so sure - while technology has grown by leaps and bounds, humans have the same input devices as our ancestors (two ears and two eyes!). Just a thought!

Student22	Student63	1	"Hi Yi-Chen, I like your idea of an ITS - one item you might want to consider is a test that gets progressively harder or easier based on past responses. For example when I took the Oracle Java Programmer Certification exam the test did this - you got more questions that are easier to solve if you're having trouble in the test. On the other hand if you're doing very well on the test they give you fewer yet harder questions as part of your certification test. You might want to tie that in with your 'Hint' database - I realize that makes the programming more difficult - just a suggestion. Another suggestion: You may want to consider having someone proofread your final paper - I do not know but I suspect that English may not be your native language - and if so English must be very hard to learn! In a few spots (here is some text from the introduction section) - there were a few small mistakes - you may want corrected in the final paper - I want you to get the best grade possible!

I see there are some risks in your plan on the platform side especially - so you might want to have a fallback plan just in case.

It looks like your group was thorough in detail throughout the entire proposal. I feel like you included all the relevant information within this one proposal, such that it was not required to have read any of your previous papers to understand the issue your addressing and how your plan to address it.

Student52	Student16	1	"Hi [lastname], Great proposal! I�m always interested in methods to improve a process and in this case with how you�re approaching improving the ability to learn course content through mobile spaced-repetition. That�s not a concept that I�ve necessarily heard of before, but it sure sounds familiar to the approach that should be used when a student is learning specific content. I think this will be an exciting project and even more exciting to see how its use is played out with teachers and students. You did well on presenting your project idea and how you plan to execute it. Now comes the fun part of following through on our projects. Your project somewhat reminds me of the subject that I�m studying, Intelligent Tutoring Systems. These topics are par[firstname]lly related in that both approaches look for ways to improve a learner�s ability to retain information or study more effectively. The slight differences being your application will involve human interaction which greatly diminishes the struggle that is presented with ITS�s and how to make them fully autonomous. The human-element with your project is definitely more effective at this point in time. I�m not sure if you�ve read much into ITS�s but with a project like this that you are researching, I could easily see this progressing towards a type of Intelligent Tutoring System. Again, great work and I think that the overall direction of this project is focusing on quality of learning. Good luck and I hope to hear more throughout the course!"	10/10/2015 10:59	866	4

As a somewhat new parent, I was enthralled to read your project proposal. I was even more interested when you mentioned your approach to create a solution using an intelligent tutoring system as that is the field of research that I�m pursuing in this course. ITS�s seem to be the ultimate learning tool, in my opinion. I don�t think that we�re nearly to point yet where they can be fully autonomous and completely replace the classroom learning experience, but they serve as an incredible supplemental tool. I think an app like this could generate a lot of excitement in the early-childhood education field to help counter this language gap issue. I agree that making a solution like this available on mobile and tablet devices is key considering access to these types of devices are prevalent. Plus the idea of offline capability is an interesting solution to work around times when the device may not have Internet access, but still upload content from the app once Internet connection has been restored. Great work and I certainly look forward to hearing more about this project throughout the course."	10/10/2015 11:13	1008		
Student52	Student24	2	"Hi [firstname], Interesting project proposal! I have not considered team forming as much of an issue in the OMSCS project until I read your paper. I�ve only been in one class so far, Software Development Process, that was heavily group-based and my experience in that class with a group was very positive. I�ve read and heard from other students that my experience is not always the same across other groups. To some effect, I almost see this type of solution as a match-maker program but obviously for CS students instead. Some of the ideas that I was thinking through while rea[lastname]g your paper for grouping students together are the same ideas you already proposed, such as geographic locations, time/availability, background, and even common interests. One of the main questions that I asked myself about your proposal is does this process diminish the real-world experience that students may face in careers where they are paired with a group that they are not compatible with, but must find common ground to work with regardless? I think that question is beyond the scope of your project and I think this is a great idea for automating the group forming process altogether in the OMSCS program. I was glad to see you made reference to advanced search capabilities in your proposal that mentions forming combinations of students in matching or opposing attributes. I think this will be helpful depen[lastname]g on the class and project, so great work on inclu[lastname]g this flexibility within the program. Overall, I was very impressed with the level of detail you included in your project proposal, especially already having created a UML class model and data model. I think you�re off to an incredible start already and I hope to hear more about your project throughout the course. Great work!"	10/10/2015 11:30	949	7	"Thank you [firstname]. You made a great point about working in group projects in real-world situation and how students must need to adept to find common ground to get along. The tool is not meant to provide any wrong perception about kind of work environment they will have to face outside the educational institutions.The tool is merely meant to facilitate the process of team formation. Regardless of how ba[firstname]d my algorithm will pair up the teams, I believe there will still be cases where some students will end up having a bad experience with working on group projects. This is also true about the real world environment and how teams are paired up in existing process. Hopefully with time and tuneup the tool might be able to provide better success rate for forming teams with least amount of manual interaction."

They know how to write code that can compile, but fail to come up with elegant or even correct solutions. ""Presenting programming in the most positive light so as to spark ini[firstname]l interest"" Is it a bad thing to lure in a bigger audience, ini[firstname]lly? I think almost all subjects try to make learning fun and dress it up in various ways. ""As a result, some of the less appealing parts of programming such as syntax errors are hidden from the child"" Is syntax all that important? It is very easy to grasp and modern IDEs all have syntax checking and correction. ""Second, they also tend to mislead children that visual languages are viable going forward"" There are very visual elements in even enterprise code. I agree co[lastname]g isn't 100% visual. But many times while writing BPEL there is a visual flow diagram for a workflow. The visual aspect is important, but there is code behind it as well. I'm not sure if anyone ever promised these kids ""programming is entirely visual"". The thing about scratch is, I think its design for an age where kids cannot actually write Java code. They're simply to young. So to get the same audience to write actual code wouldn't be right. I'm not sure what the next logical step after scratch would be, maybe it could be your game? I don't see anything wrong with Scratch itself though, it is aiming for the youngsters. If you haven't played this yet it seems like a really fancy implementation of your idea https://www.co[lastname]game.com/ Definitely check out the game I suggested and think over my replies to your issues raised. I really like your idea, but whenever I read anything I always play devil's advocate even If i'm rooting for the other side of the argument..."	10/10/2015 16:05	641		
Student46	Student78	2	"Overall this seems like a very solid idea. Your final draft had a very nice level of detail, I liked the diagram you provided. If you find leftover time maybe you can find existing APIs for facial recognition and some of the fancier features you had envisioned. I wouldn't try taking on these problems without calling someone else's API due to the restricted time."	10/10/2015 16:16	259

Student46	Student64	2	"This is a really interesting topic to explore and I look to seeing the results. You have a ton of interviews lined up!

Student13	Student16	1	"Hi [lastname]! I really liked your project proposal for CS6460. Implementing a mobile space-repetition system for learning and evaluation is going to be an interesting endeavor. In terms of the opening and background, I like how you introduced spaced repetision as a technique for long term memorization. Interestingly enough it is a technique I have been doing without knowing what it is called for years. Explains my ""see it three times"" rule. As you think about writing it up, I wonder, are there any good journal articles you can point to that support your theory? This was one of the pieces that I missed in this section. I would love to see how people have compared this learning to traditional cramming. Also, where or how does the literature talk about scheduling and its impact on memory. What is it about scheduling that specifically causes something to be retained or now. Again, if you were going to be writing things up then absolutely I would think you might want to include that to really strengthen what is already a good piece of work. For example, talking about ""graduated-interval recall"" can be something that is explored. One thing that jumped out to me is your comparison and the competition section. You talk about other competitiors. I know you are designing a new project. Would love to see a table of the feature comparisons so that you can show how yours is really different or what you will try to add. You talk about others having ""little success"". That would help and in my mind help strengthent the requirements piece for your product. In terms of the total overall value, for me, this was a part that I would have loved to see you go deeper. For example, you talk about the evaluation component having several ""useful pieces"". That said, for me, it was very much a ... based on what? That would have helped! The same was true for entertainment. What pieces will you add that are entertaining and why will it work? How will you test it? Educational gaming is a tough space and entertainment levers are always being experimented with. Would love for some more concrete exploration here to help. Overall, your deliverable schedule looks good. A question - as a person who runs large software projects and teams & builds. How confident are you on your deliverable schedule. For example, are your user interface mock-ups done? This doc was submitted when they were supposed to be done and I am curious. Also, what happens if your algorithm selection and timing is delayed? What testing? This feeels like a lot of pressure, though I like the scope and the goal. Overall, an excellent project! Loved your write-up.

Student13	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname]! I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your proposal! Intelligent tutoring systems is an interesting area. One thing that I would like to offer - especially if you are looking to publish this, is just to keep encouraging even more referencing. In teh foundations section, I was fascinated by what you wrote and wanted more references to jump off from. For example, you cited the Educause Learning Ini[firstname]tive. Do you have other citations that might help? What is it about these intelligent tutoring systems that needs the most work or is capable of making these systems most successful? As I continued to read through, I really like how you worked through things. Your analysis and descriptions of what you saw as the problem areas were very interesting. That said, the same questions came to mind that I look forward to seeing you explore. You talked about having them research ""security-type solutions"" that already exist and I am curious where you plan to start? For example, how would you use this in your poten[firstname]l project or solution. Actually, this is where I had confusion - as I suddenly was unclear whether you were buil[lastname]g a project or solution or just doing research? I ask this because you outlined a whole host of issues that you want to follow up with. That said, am interested in things. In terms of your proposed student task list, I am intrigued on the tasks that you presented. You have a lot of reserach tasks that you need to present and focus on, inclu[lastname]g the user of intelligent tutoring systems, private sector languages, etc. A question for you - how will you know that you have have done enough research into each of the areas to be able to move forward? For example, you talk about learners programming as a research sub area. What will you be looking to cover in this part of your work? As I look at your project, I like your project schedule. My one questions is goals now and end deliverables. What are the end deliverables that you would like to pursue? Is it a paper that you are going to produce? A group of papers? A group of sub papers? Also, I would love to see even more specificity later in the conclusions. For example, when you note that you will spend 11 hours ""looking at new models to propose for improving the use of emotional agens with ITS"", do you have any guidelines that you will be looking to follow or any prior hypothesis? Will you look to produce a 3 page summary? In short, what are you shooting at? What does gold look like? Overall I loved rea[lastname]g your project proposal? I can't wait to see how things go and love working on projects like this. Would love to even work with you later and produce a published meta-analysis.

Your treatment of the subject and outline of research areas is generally thorough (IMO) and I like that you plan to take into account a variety of metrics on how best to measure contribution. Here what I would add that you might consider: 1. Real-world I am a big believer in [lastname]sparency, so for example if I am taking a course with a clear gra[lastname]g rubric for success, then i am happy that I understand what I am signing up for and will behave accor[lastname]gly - ideally gearing my efforts to match any rubric - and it matters, in principle, to me whether the grader is machine or human. 2. As a practical matter I prefer a wider rubric that considers wider factors of contribution, as you have indicated. 3. What is really interesting to me is ultimately how you test/validate these - and to design the system so that input rubrics can be compared to some form of outcome assessment and judged on performance/prediction/validity. 4. I'm always concerned if I spend more time in some sense 'teaching to the test' or 'fighting the tool' rather than deep learning - so my thought is to keep it light, and to have humans in the loop.

I see that this project will help students to apply concepts from different programming languages across the board. I think this will definitely be intensive due to the syntax issues. I see that you are aware of that when you said you would cover basic functions because the libraries are extremely immense. Excellent project though.

Student11	Student49	0	"Interesting project. I think it took a bit too long to get into what your proposed solution is, but that's besides the point now. I think you guys have a large chunk of work to do split amongst the team. I almost feel like you're spen[lastname]g too much time in the ini[firstname]l design/mockup phase. Since there are so many moving pieces with the VMs, backend server, and front end client, I think you should dive in and iterate rapidly. Are there contingency plans in place if you can't get the VM piece going? That is a big red flag for me due to not having much experience with guacomole and the amount of resources required to get that piece going. Can you fake it with a JS console?"	10/11/2015 12:26	831

I wish I could give more input, but I am way out of my area of expertise with what you guys are trying to accomplish. If I had one note, it would be to look into some cross platform tool to develop for Android & iOS.

The implementation plan is well thought through and I think you've done a good job looking at open source solutions you can leverage. I don't have much else to say. Good luck!	10/11/2015 11:18	5702		
Student11	Student38	0	"I think you guys have carved out a feasible chunk of work to accomplish for the semester. If I had a suggestion, I would move the user interface to higher priority just due to the fact that you can fake the other stuff. You can't fake a good UI. So if you get that piece done earlier you also have more time to iterate on the UI. Although, the UI may not be that important to a successful project here. Good luck!"	10/11/2015 11:18	6006		
Student28	Student91	1	This is a great and helpful idea to subsidize MOOC classes. For a tool like this the hardest part is implementing all of the features stated yet have it runs fast and smooth. Good luck!	10/11/2015 13:00	318	7	
Student28	Student61	1	"This sounds interesting. Do you think the difficulties in learning to program lies in the language or more in the rationales? While it's important to know to how to use a programming language, I think getting people to ""think"" in the programming rationale is the bigger challenge. Good luck, looking forward to the end product!"	10/11/2015 14:51	463		
Student28	Student17	1	I reviewed your first draft and liked it. It would be a nice tool to have and yield great benefit for those in the program. Good luck and looking forward to your product!	10/11/2015 15:00	116		
Student28	Student46	1	This is an good approach to teach the focused topic. Have you played the Lumosity brain games before? There's a module that's for math calculations that's similar where the equations are dropping and user has to enter the correct answer it reaches the line. Good luck with your project!	10/11/2015 15:02	329	6	
Student51	Student60	0	"You seem to have a well researched and thought out plan. Two ares I don't see mentioned you might want to consider if you haven't yet. The first is FERPA and what protections you need in place to host class rosters.

Student80	Student47	1	"Are there any unanticipated factors in your research that might [lastname]e the output? I imagine the most likely possibility is a [lastname]e of scope, depen[lastname]g on how much you find out there. How long will you make the paper? That number will help you to gauge scope. I suppose hours will, too, although the difficulty of the research may [lastname]e that. (eg if you end up doing more quantitative analysis, you might not get as far.) How do you imagine it being structured? As a literature review? Is there a stance you will take on how things should be? It seems like you might be able to do a meta-analysis based on the data-sets that you find. It would be interesting to see how many papers agree with each other, and how many may just be coincidence. What is your motivation for this work? It relates indirectly to my project, which is on cooperation in collaborative learning. Why do disruptors disrupt? On the subject of organization, I am planning on doing a poll on reference management, since it's not easy and it's always evolving. That may be interesting. I like the idea of blocking off time. In such an open ended subject, it can be easy to get behind."	10/12/2015 3:07	757		
Student80	Student95	1	"Hey, it's good to be reviewing your project again. I have plans to build a robot for work, so keep me in the loop on this. I am happy to provide feedback: Student80. I'm curious about the laser cutter aspect. My significant other is thinking of buying this: http://glowforge.com/ what kind of laser cutter would a student want? Will you include content to make selection easier? How many hours would you estimate it requires to follow the designs you've put together? That is, let's say you are done and can post the guide. How much time would it take me to follow your guide and build the robot? I know it's a vague question, but I think it affects how you will use it in class (something you already have data on) and who might sign up (imagine it was a MOOC)."	10/14/2015 17:44	541		
Student80	Student86	1	"EMOT, clever! Reminds me of the [lastname]forcement learning topic KWIK ""knows what it knows."" Why not publish your results? IRB is a lot of work, but if you do it now, you have the option of publishing. I am not sure if you can go back and do so if you have interesting data. What are you plans to handled the unexpected? For example, what if you don't get enough volunteers for the research? I understand you could redirect someone to another task, but what if you have to redirect everyone? What if you have one student per group, will that be sufficient? Do you see any other poten[firstname]l hazards in the future? What kind of after the fact analysis will you do? I think this is what you are referring to as inference, but it seems vague. Can you make a hypothesis about your expectations now, and test that? How would you build a testable hypothesis around humor? How will your qualitative analysis be structured? How much will you [firstname]ght surveys vs class performance and teacher perception? What results have you seen in past studies that inform your experiment structure? In your sections of questions to answer, are these grounded in past research? I see your citations, but I don't see the relationship between the citations and the questions. Do the cited articles inform your design plans? I can imagine you don't have room in the proposal to address these items. I address it because I imagine that, as you go into putting together the material, you might find the existing research doesn't address what to do."	10/14/2015 20:46	441		
Student80	Student81	1	"Consider an abstract at the front of your paper. Setting the stage is relevant, but, as a reader, I want to get my bearings quickly. What am I rea[lastname]g? The problem statement helped, but when I read the solution, I still didn't know what your project actually was about. What is HoloLens? How does it address the problem? To clarify, your paper flows very nicely, and it builds suspense, but that's confusing in a proposal! I'm curious what your elevator pitch was. That might be a good thing to lead with. It seems like it may be difficult to draw conclusions without an actual HoloLens. Would you characterize this as a literature review? How will you measure success? Might you conclude that HoloLens is a bad choice based on your inputs, or do you intend to show that there is no way to tell without running the study for which you are requesting fun[lastname]g? Do you anticipate Microsoft might reply before the end of the semester? Your status at Ft Detrick seems like it could help with that. Is this a part of a project there presently? Do you have support from others at your workplace for the project? If they withdrew support, would that affect your research this semester? Doing a fun[lastname]g proposal seems like a great application of this class. I have been thinking about how to continue my research after this semester, and fun[lastname]g is, of course, an issue. What do you imagine the contents of the capability assessment to be, beyond the key tasks. For example, will you focus on existing publications? Interviews? I think the concept is interesting, and it would be fantastic if it all works out.

Student21	Student85	1	Nice proposal. Success of these applications depend on usability. Are you planning to review your UI with end users or reviewers periodically?	10/12/2015 12:33	1300	5	
Student21	Student59	2	Well done!. Technology and design are explained in detail. Ad[lastname]g a prototype of the design(doesn't have to be functional) would help the reviewer get a better idea of the proposal.	10/12/2015 12:56	710	5	
Student21	Student101	1	All the best with the research. In our school district teachers usually have a 2 days in a year for professional development.

I would suggest maybe ad[lastname]g texture, patterns, or shapes to the some of the balls (red=horizontal stripes, blue=vertical, green=diagonal, or red=circle, blue=square, green=triangle). Also it would be nice if you could setup an API to export student progress/activity to another site. I could see you going for a bonus round in this project with using a different number base (hexadecimal, octal, sexagesimal). Do you plan to actually quiz students after playing the game? Will you have before and after quizzes?

If you are able to just get some of the disparate platforms that would be great. I find myself having at least 3 or 4 tabs open for peerfeedback, tsquare, and piazza or Udacity to work on coursework. I know this is a massive undertaking but if you added a note taking area for student s too that would be snaptastic! I am using the google app engine and I think integrating with their hangouts API will be viable for chat. https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/. I would even suggest you look at using then as an alternate for hosting if you ave issues with Heroku. I think you get integration with google open authentication with the App engine too.

I have tried to work on a fin[lastname]g a cost effective modular setup to introduce kids to programming with RaspberryPI but keep running into misconceptions and lack of interest (from educators) about how kids could learn from a small affordable computer. I am very excited about what your research comes up with. It is my perception that most K-12 Educators in my area believe you have to have to spend thousands of dollars for computer equipment per child and it will be obsolete in <3 years. Also on a side note, I feel the group proposals I have looked at are a notch above the individual ones. It really does help to have a collaborator."	10/13/2015 10:14	606

After much much research and false starts I think I will be going with paperjs and apache cordova to build the game for ios, android and fireos. There are just so many canvas js libraries to choose from. It's a bit overwelming to a rookie game developer who only has a few weeks to make it happen. Anyway, good luck.

I look forward to rea[lastname]g the results of your study. I would suggest that you take the time to estimate hours of work for each the tasks you have defined. The suggested number of hours per student is 100. I wonder if you may find you have committed to many more hours of work than that. Just something to consider this week as you are tuning your proposal for the final proposal. Also, I would suggest that you consider developing a set of specific observations that you can score for all students regardless of age to get some data that can be easily compared across age groups. Personally I would be interested to hear if there is a correlation between the type and number of programs that the students of a course are required to write and how well the students feel they learned the language. Good luck with your project. In general, I like what you are proposing, but I do feel you may want to narrow the focus some if possible."" I still feel like you may have under-estimated how much time this will take, but it's not an all or nothing thing, is it?

Student66	Student48	1	This should be an interesting project and I like that you are basing your study on already-existing public data. I think the concerns you raised about the data are definitely valid. You mentioned that you intend to conduct a survey to get more finely-grained information on how students actually feel about the data. Do you intend to distribute this to a variety of districts or are you aiming to just do this in your local county? Either approach is fine but there may be some bias if you focus locally.

Student66	Student7	2	"Outstan[lastname]g project, while I (to this day) have never learned iOS, I did learn Android when I was just beginning programming. I remember struggling with some of the very things you were describing (How do I move from these examples into what I want to do? What other good resources are there besides Google's Android site?) so I think there is a definite need for your website. One question I had is whether you intend to embed a development environment into the website like Codecademy does or whether you will walk the person step-by-step in setting up their environment. Also, how do you intend to compile your list of resources, are they sites that you typically go to now or when you were just starting out? Finally, will you continue to support this site after the class is over? I could definitely see myself using it. Thank you for that list of resources, I've been meaning to do some iOS development and I might use those to get started."	10/12/2015 18:49	3484		
Student66	Student70	2	"This is a great project in terms of subject and I like your plan on going about solving it. You guys did an outstan[lastname]g job laying out implementation details in terms of technologies that will be used. All in all, this is one of the best proposals I have read to date. I have two questions for you on the intent of the project, however. Do you have any data on what percentage of lower-income families have a tablet (your primary platform)? I don't have an answer myself, but it's worth looking into as a next step in case you decide to take this further than the classroom, if only to make sure you are hitting the platform lower-income families are most likely to own. Also, how will you make money on this application? You mentioned yourself that many of the solutions in the space charge money for their use, money which the lower-income families may not have to spend on this app. How would you monetize this app going forward? Best of luck!"	10/12/2015 19:48	886	7	
Student66	Student84	1	"This is definitely a worthwhile project as big data and global communication enable us to construct these large datasets to see how our own children's development compares with others. Your reductions to the scope of the project seem pretty wise as this project is a pretty massive undertaking. I think demonstrating a proof of concept for this project will be adequate as, once the infrastructure is laid, you will have no end of opportunities to improve it going forward. On that note, one bit of advice I would have is, if you don't know the unstructured data formats like MongoDB and NoSQL, you may want to omit them for the first iteration of this project and then go back to add them later. The choice is yours, however. I think any final solution will ultimately require them. Good luck!"	10/12/2015 20:03	825	6

Student58	Student93	2	That was a really interesting read. How are you creating your synthetic data? Did I miss the details of that in the proposal? It seems like you have quite the handle on the modeling aspect of this project and I look forward to seeing what you can produce.	10/12/2015 22:20	2925	6	Good question...because modeling of the data IS important
Student58	Student50	1	"This actually aligns nicely with the project I'm working on, analyzing OMSCS data to see the predictors of student success. I'm interested in what you survey data will expose about withdrawal rates. The OMSCS a [firstname]rd hybrid between the other MOOCs and a traditional program, so the students involved and their academic motivations might differ quite significantly from those in the MOOCs with the rock bottom completion rates. In one of my earlier papers, I was defining success in a MOOC in a way that included completion. Someone pointed out that, for many students, one of the strengths of the MOOCs is that important education can be gained without nee[lastname]g to complete the course. You can just sample the material, get what you need and stop with no consequence. Just something to consider as you do your analysis."	10/12/2015 23:09	680		
Student58	Student20	1	"You have a well thought out plan. I haven't seen many people trying to address on the job learning from a business perspective, so this is interesting. Many businesses seem to be hesitant to provide training, so creating a system that provides a way of [lastname]sferring knowledge from experts within the company at a low cost would be very valuable."	10/12/2015 23:20	1708		
Student59	Student98	1	"Interesting project. I will say that I am not 100% sure if you are just delivering the prototype here, or if you are planning on implementing this with actual students and parents. I am interested in how you will be evaluating the efficacy of the tool. Would be interesting to have at least mock-data for showing how correlations can be found using the tool, even if the correlations are based on made up data."	10/12/2015 22:30	1461

Student5	Student15	2	"Tagging, from my researches, is the best way to organize and search information. It is useful especially when the process can be automated. ElasticSearch is great for full text searches (my company uses it). And API is a great way to encapsulate backend logic. Good job!"	10/13/2015 12:46	1019

Student93	Student9	1	"I like this proposal as it raises questions first which is very important to do BEFORE starting the project itself. You have mentioned proposing a model which would correlate with the learning outcome. I am VERY curious of what your model would look like. What methodologies are going to be using to create the model? analyze the model? what kind of data? From looking at your tasks, you do not explicitly cover the model creation. There are two poten[firstname]l reasons for that: - you might already have something in mind (thus not inclu[lastname]g the implementation details) - you are underestimating the effort of modeling Regardless of your particular scenario, it would be beneficial to discuss the modeling aspect more. Besides the modeling part, I don't have anything else to add. It looks good and it is more that I could personally accomplish in a semester, so good luck"	10/13/2015 12:58	11	6	
Student93	Student75	1	"I like the state diagram -- it looks complete (almost make you feel like the project is complete). The core of your project is the LP optimizer and I think you glossed over the details here: -- are you going to be using an open source library for that, like cvxpy or lpsolve? If yes, I highly recommend cvxpy. If no, I highly recommend cvxpy :) -- your assumptions are hinting a little bit about the type of the objective function and the constraints to be used. I think a formal description of the optimization problem would have been beneficial. -- how are you going to declare a success? would it be based on the user experience or some different metric? sometimes defining those metric can help with understan[lastname]g the requirements upfront. There is not much else I would add and the tasks are pretty descriptive. On the overall project goal -- I would like to see this system live as I constantly try to optimize my time for classes. Even if I take a single class (which I do), I still want to be able to understand the level of effort from each class. So good luck!!"	10/13/2015 20:53	1061		
Student93	Student10	2	"This proposal stands out in my mind because it is firmly rooted in existing solutions, PLUS it provides a solid theory behind the new solution. I, probably, am biased for multiple reasons -- I enjoy learning new languages and I always enjoy rea[lastname]g theory. Very often project proposals are very vague (largely due to uncertainty ), however you clearly have planned it thoroughly and I wish more proposal are done in this way. One more thing that I would add: think about how are you going to evaluate the success of your project. What metrics are you going to use? How are you going to iterate from one model to another?"	10/14/2015 16:10	536		
Student93	Student2	1	"Hi [firstname], I believe this idea will work pretty well as there is a strong foundation behind spaced repetition. I am also a big proponent of chunking and consistent learning which supports the idea of learning as a habit. The clarity of the proposal with the section separation makes it easy to access what the project will try to accomplish in the current semester and I have not much to add to the structure of the proposal. However, I would recommend ad[lastname]g a section on methodology: - How are you going to decide the repetition? What to show? Is that up to the student? - Would there be some individualized model per student? Would some be able to get quizes based on the weak spots? - How are you going to measure the success of the project? This of course does not have to be scoped in this semester, but going forward you could start thinking about creating some success stories. Maybe just collecting user feedbacks?"	10/18/2015 12:03	1626

Student95	Student47	1	"This sounds like an excellent research paper. I am a middle school teacher and have been for the last 14 years. Classroom management is always a challenge, especially for new teachers (my first year teaching was the year from hell!) Anything you can add to helping new teachers is a noble endeavor.

Student95	Student56	1	"This sounds like a very interesting and useful paper. As a middle school teacher, I am concerned about the testing strategies that are used in school There has to be a better way than filling in the bubbles. Good luck with your paper."	10/13/2015 16:24	359		
Student95	Student19	1	"I like your project! It seems very interesting and ambitious. I have taught computer science to middle school kids for the last 14 years. I have taught all sorts of basic (visual basic, quick basic, realbasic) but now I mainly teach scratch and javascript via khanacademy.org/cs. Check out the khanacademy programming tutorials, they are very good. I like your Mario type idea to teach programming. It sounds engaging. I look forward to seeing your project running! Good luck."	10/13/2015 16:31	884	6	
Student85	Student44	1	"As far as the the proposal goes, I was expecting to see some sort of problem statement along the lines of ""X% of students who start college do not finish and this costs the economy Y dollars per year"". Is the dropout rate high? Too high? Who says? I presume that the numerous sources would answer all of these questions and more, but as a reader of the proposal I have no idea what the answers would be or why the proposed project is important. Now, it happens that I agree that too many teenagers start college, fritter away their parents' money, and never earn a degree. So I'm with you on the research question. Again, though, the proposal doesn't indicate why research into apps will address the problem. My gut is that no number of iOS apps will solve the problem of college dropouts, so I'd need some convincing in the proposal."	10/13/2015 18:45	492		
Student85	Student5	2	"Your proposal is thorough and complete - very good work! I wonder about the feasibility of collecting data from all of the desired/required sources, but I defer to your judgment on that point. From a project delivery perspective, your team's project is one of the best I've reviewed, so I'm confident you can do it! One point that I did not find clearly defined has to do with the login: Since this is an OMSCS tool I assume that users will sign in with the GATech CAS application. If you're not planning on that, please do! Neither I nor any other student wants to use a tool that requires a new user ID/password!!"	10/13/2015 21:59	563		
Student85	Student15	1	"This is an interesting project. At times I have wanted a better way to search for articles/content at my personal knowledge level, so I see the usefullness of such an application. One thing that is not clear from the proposal is the project's scope. To what body of content will the tags be applied? Not globally across the Internet, I assume? Given that assumption, how will an average learner benefit from the application? Or is it only for material referenced by a particular learning management system? Also, who will tag the content? Is this to be done manually? At what cost? Another point I am prone to harping on is that of logging on. No one needs another username/password - how will a student authenticate in this application? Finally, there are quite a number of grammar and spelling problems in your document. You might consider getting a professional proofreader before submitting this proposal for review outside of CS 6460."	10/13/2015 22:08	611		
Student85	Student98	1	"[firstname], I gave feedback on your application before, so this may not be new information. As I recall, one of my concerns was manual data entry on the part of students, which in my experience means the application will be severely underutilized. It's an understandable limitation, especially in a first release, but long term it's a problem. Going nationwide is ambitious - good - and this presents several challenges, inclu[lastname]g identifying students and getting users logged in as they move from school to school. I assume you do not want to capture SSN as a student identifier, but you do not indicate what you would use in its place. Similarly, no one needs a new login/password but you do not address the question of authentication in terms of a portable logon such as OpenID or Shibboleth. I believe you have a good core idea to build on with student data visualization and I'd hate to see it founder because the infrastructure limits usability."	10/13/2015 22:19	654		
Student12	Student3	2	This is a solid and well thought out plan. I hope your outcome proves a successful approach on readability to provide more efficient use on technology.	10/13/2015 19:53	291		
Student12	Student94	2	I really like your proposal. You've listed seem excellent hurtles with incorporating technology in schools. I hope your research yields positive results to reduce the technology gap. Good luck!!	10/13/2015 19:58	502		
Student12	Student30	1	"I think it's good to know where we currently stand with educational technology, especially if we plan on improving it. The wiki is a good place to collect and distribute that information. Good luck!"	10/13/2015 20:07	487	5	"Thank you, [firstname], me too... ;)"

Student71	Student18	1	"Interesting project. I like the concept and purpose. One suggestion I have is a very small item but something that has bothered me about surveys in the past. Often I would like to refer to the survey later, as a survey taker, and see my answers. That is virtually never an option when I take online surveys. The option to email the questions and answers someone gave might be a nice CH."	10/13/2015 22:28	1421		
Student71	Student51	2	This is an incredible project with an incredible team. These guys are good. ;)	10/13/2015 22:51	82	7	
Student71	Student60	1	"Well done and interesting plan. I think the concept of study groups provides incentive and camaraderie that will indeed increase participation. I do think that MOOC provide less incentive than programs like OMS CS and nano degree programs, as having a class completion certificate is less rewar[lastname]g than earning a degree of some kind. However, I do think peer involvement in study groups is a great motivator to succeed."	10/13/2015 22:53	1234	6	The feedback was helpful.
Student77	Student50	1	"Hi [firstname], It looks like you have a great timeline and plan rolled out for this proposal (and it sounds like you're familiar with writing research papers based on how formal this proposal is written!). It took me a while to find your goal, which is: ""At bare minimum, we can seek to provide retention statistics for the OMSCS program that are on par with those available about MOOCs."" Is this something that the dean's office or OMSCS advisors could simply provide based on acceptance, registration and graduation figures kept by the school? And surveying mid-semester provides some bias in that students who are in class in November are likely not dropping out... If anything, I'd urge you to expand your goal for the survey to look at how the OMSCS population differs from that of your typical MOOC and how this might lead to increased retention rates (since we know its above 7%!). Factors like what is the core driver for participation (a career [lastname]e?), how an admissions process influences retention, etc. Best of luck, eager to see your fin[lastname]gs!"	10/13/2015 22:46	298		
Student77	Student58	1	"Okay, so I'm going to be candid and say that when I saw your proposal had a table of contents and 10 pages, I immediately started skimming. Got to the end and am not quite sure what to takeaway from the project other than the fact that if I want to understand what you're researching, that I will need to dedicate an hour to dense literature. I think there is some gains to be made by refining this to be a ""pitchable"" outline of your project, removing some of the details you've included and making it more audience-friendly. At the end of the day, kudos to y'all for having an indepth plan for next steps. But for your mentor or a peer reviewer, this is a little overwhelming."	10/13/2015 22:51	181		
Student77	Student32	2	"Wow--team, this is the most readable AND in-depth report that I've read. I'm not going to comment so much on the concept/idea since I'm sure peer reviewers have been talking about it for a few weeks (months?) now, but I do like how you are approaching this project from a group perspective. Having a repo and tracking issues via GitHub is A+, and I might recommend also [lastname]sferring this timeline into a project management tool like Trello to help manage individual tasks and where they stand (if SDP has taught me anything, its having visibility into the work being done by your groupmates is critical!) Best of luck, I'm excited to see the final result."	10/13/2015 22:54	189		
Student77	Student20	1	"Hi there, going to give you some light[firstname]ght feedback since at this point I don't think starting (another) conversation about the topic or product itself will be very useful to you! I really like that you estimated how many hours each stage in the process will take (and that there's time built in for integration testing and bug fixes...a software team after my own heart!) but I'd really strongly recommend setting up some group processes upfront--like a Trello board for task assignment + management, a github repo for issue tracking, etc. (if you haven't already done so!) Good luck, can't wait to see the final result."	10/13/2015 22:58	158		
Student26	Student41	1	"Hello [firstname], your proposal is clear and well organized. I got a good idea of what you plan to do and how you plan to execute it. Couple of suggestions and thoughts came to my mind as I was rea[lastname]g your proposal: - accor[lastname]g to my personal experiences on the job, corporate training at times is very specific and often relates to corporations' own products and policies. If that is the case, it would be difficult to find any external SME's to answer questions. I am thinking you mean this tool to be focusing on higher-level corporate learning that is applicable across multiple organizations? - a poten[firstname]l issue I am foreseeing with this solution is scalability. Often MOOCs etc. do not offer a way to interact with professor and I think it's because they are designed to scale to n number of students without ad[lastname]g to the workload of the instructor. If this solution becomes popular and gains e.g. a few million users, what is the strategy for recruiting the necessary SME's to match the demand? - Consider utilizing some type of natural language processing to ""understand"" each question and then maintain a knowledge base of previously asked questions. Then, if multiple people ask the same question, an earlier answer can be supplied without the SME having to answer the same question again. - Technical comments: for texting you will need to use a service like Twilio, for sen[lastname]g emails you need a mail server. Many times website hosts will have integrated emailing capabilities. If you do not have such a host, you are just going for a proof of concept, you may consider setting up some email account in outlook or gmail and use their mail API to handle the emailing. Alternatively you could consider using just database backend for storing information and have the app itself generate alerts to the instructor. This could be done without texting or emailing altogether, which would simplify your development effort. The only visual difference would be how you would like the ""new posted question"" pop up in the instructor's device. - is there any way to evaluate the questions student's pose before routing them to the instructor? What if offering the ability to ask questions turns students lazy, i.e. ""won't bother to research myself, since I can just ask the instructor"". Is there any way to mitigate such side effects?"	10/14/2015 0:11	54		
Student26	Student25	1	"Hello [firstname], I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your proposal. I made a few notes regar[lastname]g your work, mainly questions I want you to consider - I noticed several references to could computing. What do you think specifically makes cloud based approach such that it cannot be achieved just by having a web-based solution? Or is cloud computing simply something that is common between all the technologies you have chosen to investigate? - Besides research question #2, I believe your research questions sound widely applicable; that is, they should apply to fields and projects outside the educational technology realm. Do you plan to address this in the final paper, or will you strictly present the fin[lastname]gs from an educational technology perspective? - In general, are the discussed technologies extendable frameworks or not? Are they proprietary or open-source? What type of people or organizations do you think will use the fin[lastname]gs?"	10/14/2015 0:12	3189		
Student26	Student68	1	"Team EMOT, I think you did a great job with your plan and the calendar of tasks is easily the most detailed calendar I have seen in all of my reviews. On page 2 I noticed questions 2 and 6 are the same. I am not sure if this was an unnecessary duplicate, or if there were supposed to be 9 unique questions. Also I noticed the questions on page 2 are quite open-ended, e.g. optimal lesson plan. I anticipate, once you collect the data, you will need to do quite a bit of analysis to discover patterns between different responses. I am also curious about the target audience of your research since you said you do not intend to publish the results. Who are the beneficiaries of this research?"	10/14/2015 23:52	120		
Student26	Student40	1	"Hello [firstname], your proposal was very clearly organized and discussed your plan in great detail. Just by looking at the current site at faculty.imperial.edu shows there is a lot of material to cover and makes me think this is a very ambitious plan. I have a couple of suggestions: - for WYSIWYG editor take a look at tinymCE - for file upload take a look at dropzone.js - for mapping objects between application and code, assuming this is what you meant with syncing processes, look up any object-relational mapping tool I will be looking forward to seeing what you come up with."	10/15/2015 0:51	593

Student17	Student46	1	"Hi [firstname], I thought that your proposal has a very interesting concept behind it. I'm also glad that you decided to scope down your project to just binary and number systems. The original scope may have been overwhelming. Looking forward to seeing how it goes."	10/14/2015 11:26	103	6	
Student17	Student91	2	"Hi [firstname], This proposal is very solid overall. However, I would advise you to take another look at your scope. For the purposes of this course and over the next few weeks, this may prove to be too large of a project. As you move forward with your project, compare it with your schedule and adjust as needed. Your project is overall a very big undertaking. I am looking forward to how it progresses."	10/14/2015 11:30	145	7	
Student17	Student64	1	"I think that this is a great topic, and one that I am personally very interested in. Although better funded schools seem to progress, schools that are lower in scores, generally from low-income areas seem to always lag behind. It should be interesting to see if there is a way that we can increase performance in those schools and areas."	10/14/2015 11:32	120		
Student17	Student78	1	"Hi [firstname], It looks like you forgot to [lastname]e the title from first draft to final draft (just an fyi). I do like the idea of your topic.

However, you have thoroughly laid out your schedule and it seems very reasonable. Looking forward to how it turns out."	10/16/2015 10:53	183		
Student41	Student1	1	"For starters, this is a very interesting topic area and I'm curious about the nature of the 30-50 questions you're going to be posing. A few comments/questions regar[lastname]g your study: Is the EdTech subreddit going to yield participants without an undergraduate degree? My guess is that people who subscribe to it are generally college educated. Regar[lastname]g Reddit's demographics, it skews heavily (http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/reddit-demographics-in-one-chart/277513/) towards young males. I don't know if there are free sites, but I found sites like https://www.researchmatch.org/ and https://www.socialsci.com/research-participants that make their business from supplying research participants. Are you going to try to capture results across multiple disciplines? It might be interesting to see if, for example, the humanities had a higher drop-out rate than the sciences. For me, the biggest factor in this study is the diverse nature of the quality of online programs. So, I might have dropped out of a program at ""School A"" whereas ""School B"" has a great program that I would have stayed enrolled in. Because collegiate online courses are a recently new phenomena, there is going to be a large disparity in term of quality. Thank you for introducing me to the notion of an ILMS. That's a really outstan[lastname]g idea to combine all of these disparate systems into a single cohesive package. I wonder, though, if their disparate (""best-of-breed"") nature doesn't create the ideal solution. To combine all of these functions into a single platform would make it quite difficult to maintain. Good luck with your project and I'm hoping that I get to see the results of your study!"	10/14/2015 10:47	4034	7	
Student41	Student68	1	"My first question is, considering this: �A recent meta� analysis in which over 650 empirical studies compared media� enabled distance learning to conventional learning found pedagogy to be more strongly correlated to achievement than media"" ...statement, are you using media as one of your research variables? That is, are you designing a study in which media is the independent variable? I'm struggling a little to determine your independent, dependent, and controlled variables. With regards to media, are your materials similar for all of your audiences? Maybe I'm misunderstan[lastname]g and media is a dependent variable. Is that what you mean when you say that you will ""use a common base set of training materials?"" It sounds like a great research topic, I think I just need a little more clarity regar[lastname]g the variables involved. Good luck with the project!"	10/14/2015 12:04	1632		
Student41	Student25	1	"This proposal is clearly laid out and I don't think that there are any ambiguities. Here are some of my thoughts... Will IAAS and PAAS be significantly different from each other when answering your three questions? I'm wondering if these two options are similar enough as to not warrant an analysis of both? This is your area of expertise, though, and I'm not an expert. I would just be sure to highlight the differences between these two similar models. Is it worth inclu[lastname]g an analysis of a non-virtual solution for the sake of comparison? Perhaps that's out of scope, but it might be the motivation for a reader to continue engaging with your content. I'm assuming that your three questions will answer the question of how much maintenance is necessary for each cloud-based technology. As a reader, pricing and maintenance expectations would be important comparison variables. Good luck with your research. I hope that I get to review your results. Also, thank you for introducing me to the Docker tool. I hadn't been exposed to it before."	10/14/2015 12:31	3243		
Student41	Student40	1	"It's good to read about another design project. I was starting to feel like I was the only one designing a solution. This sounds like a beneficial project for both you and your college. As someone who has been the recipient of a homegrown system, I would beg you to not skimp on the documentation aspect of this project. Rather than buil[lastname]g any additional functionality (like the content upload feature), it would probably be better for your college to have the attendance tracking functionality well-tested and well-documented.

Student67	Student20	1	"Hi All, I love the problem you guys are trying to solve. This is an issue I have seen in my organization. One thing that I am struggling to understand is how your app will �organically inspire innovation among colleagues, encourage collaboration, and educate the workforce on the emerging technologies within their industry.� I see all of the features your app will have such as rewards or success stories but I am not too sure if it will work. I think some research of how each of your features will help out in your mission will help. There are some motivational theories out there that can validate some of your assumptions. Two that I would recommend is the Expectancy-Value theory and the Self-Determination theory. Good luck on the project!"	10/14/2015 15:32	1197		
Student67	Student77	1	"Hi [firstname], I like the idea of a curated course library. I think the idea is pretty straight forward but there were a couple of things I was left wondering, What is if this scales? How are you going to grab content for all of the many different courses? Will be this be content from the community, the app author, or third-party service? I also thought that is pretty cool that you can leverage TestFlight for some quick user testing. Overall, I like the idea, good luck!"	10/14/2015 15:53	641

As a technical person, this would have been very interesting for me to read on how you guys plan to use some of those tools and how future researchers with probably more time and resources (other tools) could poten[firstname]lly do more interesting things with the data.

Student67	Student32	1	"Hi Tricia, [firstname], and [firstname], I love this idea. I think daily practice on any subject is essen[firstname]l if we want anything to really �stick� in our brains. I see your idea a platform for any subject and as such I had hoped to see some mockups for a more UI/UX analysis. I believe there are many apps out there with good intentions to facilitate the life of the student/teacher but fail miserably in the design of the app and how it flows from end to end. My suggestion is to build a MVP (minimal viable product) as soon as possible and publish it on your url often. Then, ask people in our class or the Google+ community about what they think about the app and adjust accor[lastname]gly based on the feedback.

This can give an added perspective if incorporated into your system as it will tell you how well written the code is, the level of duplication, and any violations of common code practices.

Apache Cordova is extremely easy to use when converting javascript projects into thinshell applications, I would imagine it would also work with the technologies you have pitched. I see a lot here about content to be delivered to the students, which is great but you may want to look into a deeper dive of the delivery to engage the students.

Student65	Student60	1	I found your proposal enlightening with a great deal of theoretical background on grouping. This was interesting to me as I just put my own students into groups for an extracurricular activity and it was a nightmare trying to match people up.

Student65	Student18	1	"Your proposal brings up an interesting concept. The only thing I am wondering about is whether self reporting is a reliable indicator. I sometimes have students who would express that they feel very confident in their understan[lastname]g, but in reality that confidence is misplaced. Perhaps that is different at the high school level compared to adults who are participating in online education though. There was enough evidence presented in your proposal supporting the concept though, to remove doubt . Your technical details are sound and it looks like you have a well defined plan. There is not much advice I can offer, as it seems you have things very well planned out."	10/14/2015 19:08	678

Student20	Student10	2	Very informative project! You have a very detailed schedule and a very ideal scope for the project. I'm interested in your intentions on converting the web app version into a Chrome extension. Perhaps this approach to language learning can be expanded to other logographic languages.

Student20	Student93	1	"This was a fascinating look at a problem that affects people with narcolepsy that many people would likely not consider. The amount of research shown in the area with the example of the ASLEPT system show a very in depth knowledge of the subject.

Student20	Student2	1	There is definitely something to be said about the effectiveness of encountering the material for several shorter sessions per week rather than one long grueling session every week or so. It reminds me of the effectiveness of exercising 20 minutes three times per week rather than 60 minutes once a week. The project you are proposing would definitely bring course content into a much more palatable format for students that are constantly on the go. I look forward to seeing how your project develops!	10/14/2015 19:31	402		
Student2	Student72	1	"Interesting project! The proposal's come and gone, so I'll try to comment on the project itself. From rea[lastname]g your paper, I can tell you two are well versed on the techniques and poten[firstname]l advantages of the Montessori approach. Which is a critical foundation in pursuing your project! I'm also pleased to hear the focus of your research is on the use of technology-enabled versus traditional Montessori. I think that's both useful and accomplishable for the semester. The one area I wasn't sold on was the feedback gathering from your experiment. And that may be the most crucial part! You don't want to run a beautifully designed and well intentioned trial and not gather convincing data. The questionnaire sounds well rounded and is a good start, but I'd stop and think critically about what you'll do with your final data. I'd also strongly encourage some sort of quantitative feedback. I know it often feels contrived to ask for 1-5 ratings on complicated subjects, but you might find a place for such a question. Good luck! [firstname] Student2"	10/14/2015 21:56	850		
Student2	Student10	2	"Woah, this is a great project idea! Seriously -- one of my favorites I've read so far. In fact, it's such a well thought out idea (and solid proposal) that I have pretty limited feedback to give you. That's the tragedy of doing great work I suppose! I think Flask is a solid choice. Do you have particular reasoning for it as opposed to Django or Pyramid? I think Flask is the best choice for what you're doing now, but a larger application would have more trade-offs. I'm not questioning your choice, just trying to give some useful food for thought. Parting words: NLP's a difficult and vast field. If you're struggling with available NLP tools, I wouldn't sweat making limited, manual input for your application as a demo. I don't think anyone would fault you for that. Have fun! [firstname] Student2"	10/14/2015 22:10	961		
Student2	Student75	1	"Cool idea! I'm not 100% clear on the focus of your program. Is it primarily a student oriented scheduling program, or a tool for administrators that students voluntarily use to show course interest distribution? On the scheduling side, there's a similar product for my alma mater: http://yacs.me/ And, I'd be surprised if GT didn't have something similar! Maybe take a look at that as well. Either way, it sounds like your tool is sorely needed for OMSCS. I'm glad you're developing specifically for the program. I think that's a great choice, and your extensive experience as a student will help guide design decisions for the product. Can't wait to see your finished product. Have fun! [firstname] Student2"	10/14/2015 22:26	297		
Student2	Student9	1	"Fun idea, and I really like your approach. The way you're choosing to blend research and product development is definitely unique for the course -- the first I've read of its kind! As such, I'd say don't over-formalize your research portion. Think about what you stand to benefit from your research and try to tie it to specific goals in your prototype design. That is to say, I think researching with a specific question in mind regar[lastname]g your product is going to be more useful than doing genStudent76ames-for-education research. Tools list looks good -- I'm curious if you've checked out Google's Project Tango. It's primarily aimed at AR games, I've used it a bit (the dev kit is pretty affordable, I think ~$512). It also integrates with Unity really nicely. In any event, I'm looking forward to your product! Best of luck, [firstname] Student2"	10/14/2015 22:31	434		
Student47	Student4	0	"I think this is a great idea. The feedback piece is very important, I wished you would have touched on that a little more. Another key piece of problem solving and programming is the QA process. You mention testing in step 4, but I think it is important enough process that it should be highlighted more. Your idea is also great in K-12 and as more schools adopt a CS curriculum, taking something proven and well-defined that you are proposing would be a great opportunity for schools. That might just be a small point to touch on. Looks like a fun project! Good luck."	10/14/2015 23:08	288		
Student47	Student83	1	Sounds like a fun idea! I think this is such an important skillset for people to have since it helps with problem solving and critical thinking. Is your game meant to be completed in one sitting? In multiple sittings? Maybe a different level everyday? I'm not sure what your background is in programming and game design. It sounds like a lot to accomplish in a short timeframe so just make sure to give yourself enough time and focus on a couple of major scena[lastname] rather than a large quantity of small ones. Good luck!.	10/14/2015 23:14	640		
Student47	Student56	1	"This is a very controversial topic and I'm looking forward to getting a chance to hear your fin[lastname]gs in the near future. There are a couple of TedX's that talk specifically about this subject matter, so I recommend checking those out if you haven't already. Are you going to explore fun[lastname]g and using standardized tests to determine school fun[lastname]g? I think that itself opens up a whole new can of worms and problems. You will be exploring this from the perspective of the teachers and students. Will you also look into the perspective of the school administrators? What about the parents?"	10/14/2015 23:25	513	7	
Student47	Student19	1	"Sounds like a fun and cute project! I like that you will be putting it on github and so it is a great candidate for a project for a student in next semester's edtech to take over and further build out. Also, check out this series of videos from the ED Games expo if you haven't already, it might give you some more ideas: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhdwy3ASoEfkIRjSypG2am_jUOL3gCQ1e Another resource is http://csunplugged.org/activities/ which have activities that teach cs concepts. These could poten[firstname]lly be [lastname]slated to activities in-game. Good luck, look forward to playing the end result eventhough I am older than 12 :)!"	10/14/2015 23:33	851	7	
Student87	Student92	1	"A lot of individuals have expressed the desire to build an automated tutoring system to assist students in learning. I agree that with online classes (having faced this myself on several occasions), it's very hard to have individual help with your courses sometimes. So I think your solution is one that is needed. The primary element I like about your project is that it is very feasible and doesn't overextend itself like many of the other projects that I've seen. I also think that in the future, you may want to expand on the project and maybe incorporate some computer vision elements into the project so that you can tell when a learner is getting frustrated because they're not understan[lastname]g the content."	10/14/2015 23:37	531		
Student87	Student100	1	It seems like the idea of an ITS is very popular in this class (I have reviewed several students that have proposed one). I think you guys' version is the most well thought out so far with the most domain knowledge and takes a nice combination of feasibility and ambitiousness. Do you guys plan on using any Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing elements to help in the gra[lastname]g process?	10/14/2015 23:46	191		
Student87	Student66	1	"I think that even though this has been done already, you have a very unique approach of soling the problem. By not dumbing it down, the middle schoolers will be forced to learn about the Java language and it's syntax as opposed to learning learning it at a high level or some language that nobody will ever use that was created just for that program. Did you ever think about using C++ instead of Java? I think while C++ is a bit more difficult to learn, it does cover the fundamentals or programming a bit better (memory management, having to link files) and is used in actual game development? Nonetheless, I hope your project goes well because it is a solution that isn't very common right now"	10/14/2015 23:49	331	6	
Student87	Student37	1	"I do believe that many organizations are stifled because teams are very clickish and don't like to cross collaborate. I think that your solution will really help teams collaborate with each other much better and may open a dialogue as to why the teams weren't collaborating in the first place. The only problem I see is the human element of the problem still exists. Teams don't like to take advice from other teams because they feel they will be looked at as incompetent and oftentimes also feel like other teams don't have the domain knowledge necessary to make suggestions. Other than that, I think your solution is a step in the correct direction."	10/14/2015 23:55	222		
Student38	Student6	2	"This is a great proposal. It is well organized, concise, and complete. Good luck on the project!"	10/14/2015 23:43	286		
Student38	Student76	1	"This is an interesting project - it seems we are hearing more and more about Kinect in projects and it is a very exciting application. It is also quite ambitious to tie all of this together in half a semester, so if problems come up (not saying they will) be sure to consider narrowing the scope in some way. Also, wanted to comment that the graphics look really nice. Good luck on the project!"	10/14/2015 23:48	1215		
Student38	Misc3	2	This is a detailed and thorough proposal. Clearly you know exactly what you need to do. Good luck with the project!	10/15/2015 0:09	227

Student84	Student70	2	"Good luck team. you guys have it all figured out. If I were to suggest anything it would be to meet twice daily to make sure you all keep a close until the end of the project. So if each team member is responsible for separate items shouldn't be that you all only meet when you have things to show. Meet on a regular basis even if there is nothing to show. Really, your idea is great. Plan is great. Make sure execution is there too. God luck"	10/14/2015 23:23	1990	6	
Student84	Student13	2	Nothing to add. Very detailed plan. Good luck	10/14/2015 23:57	449		
Student84	Student97	1	Good. I'd say this is needed. Good luck. I think a part of your research should be looking into the Darknet. Personally I haven't paid much attention to it but as old as I am I did come across it when I realized two of my accounts were hacked. Look into Darknet for the purposes of education and seeing what is out there where there is zero security and tracking. Good luck.	10/15/2015 0:04	446		
Student84	Student96	1	"I think you're doing a good job of segmenting your work, I think you'll do well progressing to the finish line. When you get to the charting segment you may find d3 useful. Also Raphael js. But I recommend d3. Good luck"	10/15/2015 0:12	860	6

Student56	Student65	1	"Great project proposal. There's one aspect that I'm not clear on, though I suppose it's irrelevant. How does this address a problem (or does it) that is unique to the AP exams, as opposed to any other exam? Can't this app be streamlined for, say, an Am[firstname]an History Regents exam? This may be a point that you'd want to address in a brief overview in your final paper. Very thorough breakdown of all the programming points, and the clear differen[firstname]tion between teacher, admin, student, report."	10/15/2015 2:23	219	7	
Student56	Student19	2	"In short: wow. You have a masterpiece of a project proposed here. What still fascinates me is the concept of teaching programming to children. Although I suppose it makes sense, as CS becomes more fundamental in the world -- it's interesting that a six year old child can play a game to learn information and skills that I first encountered in college."	10/15/2015 2:27	177	6	
Student56	Student83	1	"Very interesting proposal. This might be a bit tangen[firstname]l, but you might want to explore Bloom's taxonomy (an educational theory) - will give you insight into the general failure to teach application and diagnostic thinking skills."	10/15/2015 2:30	121		
Student56	Student4	1	"Nice project idea. I'm curious how much research backs this, though. Is it a given that a top down approach would be more effective than the common bottom up approach?"	10/15/2015 2:32	92		
Student55	Student43	1	"This is an impressive proposal for the level of thought that's been put into the project design. I felt a couple of items on the task list would have benefitted from more detail - as it is, they make sense but are not very measurable. (If I were gra[lastname]g you, for instance, it would be hard for me to evaluate whether you have worked through ""relevant Unity tutorials"" - much easier if you listed a specific tutorial you would go through or sample app you would complete.) I'm a little surprised by the choice of Windows 7 Professional - since a couple of other Windows versions have come out since then, it seems like it might make it difficult to find an adequate number of alpha/beta testers. It's gratifying to see how much this has taken shape over the course of the term. Even though I don't drink I find myself looking forward to the final product. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/15/2015 2:24	367	6	
Student55	Student26	2	"Unfortunately, I don't have a lot to add to my comments on the draft proposal - this proposal is incredibly well-written and already represents great work in exploring existing automatic [web project] gra[lastname]g solutions and designing a new solution that might improve on them. I can't wait to see this go live. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/15/2015 2:31	208	6	I can tell based on this feedback were we fell short with the progress report. Totally different tone. Very interesting.
Student55	Student68	1	"Unfortunately, I don't have a lot to add to my feedback on the draft proposal. I found the expanded comments on your data gathering somewhat helpful - I have a better picture of what you're focusing on than I did when rea[lastname]g the draft. The CSTA whitepaper looks like a great read - I've added it to my (long, and growing) list of cool things that other students found this term that I haven't had time to read yet! I still think the parallel/comparative structure of this project is really, really neat. (It's also the kind of project that would probably be much harder to do with a team that was all in the same place.) I'm excited to read your retrospectives at the end of how it all went."	10/15/2015 2:35	499		
Student55	Student41	1	"This is an interesting idea - it seems particularly well-suited to the corporate training context you've targeted, too, since a company is likely to have a large pool of existing experts in common training areas. I feel the tasks described in the proposal would benefit from being further broken down by one level of detail. For example, I feel ""Task 1"" could probably be split into components - something like: ""Select [lastname]sportation protocol ... implement [lastname]smission on server ... select and configure database ... design schema for user info ... design schema for questions / communication content."" If you do a good job on this, it could be a genuinely significant project in the field of corporate training. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/15/2015 2:43	797		
Student92	Student77	2	"I love the concept. The more current developments in the news or outside resources can broaden our understan[lastname]g of a topic, the better. Are you going to [firstname]ght teacher's submitted resources more heavily?"	10/15/2015 2:48	1203		
Student92	Student54	2	"Seems like it will be a cool project. I'm curious as to whether there are ways for the app to be built that can't be ""gamed"" as the current ones are right now by people checking their submissions against these existing solutions. Can't wait to see the final product."	10/15/2015 3:09	493		
Student92	Student67	2	"I love the project idea. I think this goes a long way in helping students become more engaged in their own educational planning. I'm very curious as to how ionic will pan out. If it's not too late, I would give some consideration to using React Native. I've heard very good things about it. I've been very wary of using HTML to Native solutions in the past after being burned by the poor development experience of working in Phonegap. Best of luck to you"	10/15/2015 3:17	360	5	
Student92	Student82	2	Kudos on taking on such an ambitious project. I'm very curious to see how the final project turns out. I took KBAI and found the class to be fascinating. I'm working on an ITS and this type of problem is very difficult in ITS. Your validation method appears sound. Is there a large corpus of assignments that can be found online to help train/tune this application?	10/15/2015 3:23	969	6	Yes. I plan on using Wordnet.
Student91	Student64	1	"Hello [firstname] and [firstname]. I know by observing kids that when they are exposed to co[lastname]g at higher ages not all of them get the real sense of what co[lastname]g may actually represent for them and some of them don't even find it a enjoyable enough activity, even-though them are attracted by STEM oriented careers. So I believe it is actually good idea to expose kids at young ages to co[lastname]g so they are actually comfortable enough and see the true advantage of it for they purposes when they reach the age of deci[lastname]g about their careers. I would like to know at what conclusions you arrive as a result of the research."	10/15/2015 5:33	25		
Student91	Student48	1	"Hello [firstname], I also believe that understan[lastname]g and evaluating how effective distributed learning results for students for the different circumstances of the student would be an important complement for evaluating the value of the educational technology that maybe used to help it, as well as the impact and effectiveness that for example MOOCs may have through the different ages of students. I hope to see the results of your research."	10/15/2015 6:35	12		
Student91	Student66	1	"Hello [firstname], I think your idea is interesting. In my understan[lastname]g, It will need lots of testing and can be quite big depen[lastname]g of how many details of the same java compiler you may want to incorporate. Hopefully you have thought already in a scope in this regard that can provide all the elements you describe without going too complex. I may be wrong though, with how the java compiler can be used. I wish you the best with your project. Kids will be powerful if they end liking and feeling comfortable in big amounts with professional level languages."	10/19/2015 5:01	39		
Student91	Student78	2	"Hello [firstname], I find interesting the way you decompose the the parts or components of the tutoring system. I find the project a little heavy, although I don't know many details about it. I also had an idea in KBAI to motivate students by capturing visual expressions in a learning environment. I simplified it by taking advantage of the following Video Magnification technology ""http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/"". My idea was to just use ranges of motion and color [lastname]e frequencies in areas like the face and the hands and match them to positive and negative achievements and progress. I know is not that simple, that's why I didn't embark in such a project yet, but I feel your design can give a strong foundation to complement with this idea for capturing visual expressions. I would like to know what you accomplish at the end, and feel free to talk with me if you like the idea of complementing both ideas. I know it may be possible to continue working in a such projects next semester. My email is a[lastname]@gmail.com and my name is Student91. Good luck!"	10/19/2015 6:18	64

Student37	Student80	2	"Ooohhh I really like this very meta project. You lost me a little bit the way you're quantizing this data for cooperative-ness though. ""Simple cooperative games have two actions: defect or cooperate"" Not entirely true. And I'm not sure prisoner's dilemma is the right way to truly solve this, but it'll probably work for this project. When you set out to create a ""game"" to do this my brain immediately jumped to this: In any cooperative game (2+ people) with a shared goal (achieve victory), where that shared goal can technically be achieved if only one person does the work there are multiple actions a player can take. 1) Hinder - Actively preventing success, just because they can 2) Nothing - Literally just sit there doing nothing and wait for you to do it yourself 3) Teamwork - strategize, etc 4) Rambo - pursuing the same objective, but as if you weren't there. Mocking that up would take.. well something more complicated than the Prisoner's dilemma. For your analysis, Aggregating the results of game rounds should be perfect for what this course is though!"	10/15/2015 15:03	584	7	"Disagreeing with me is great, and in this case, true. Moreover, the suggested enumeration is good. I would have liked some references, though."
Student18	Student22	1	"Hi Team From the proposal I understand that your idea is something like: a. Select a common CS curriculum b. Prepare teaching material c. Deliver to different audiences f. Gather feedback g. From this feedback you will attempt to answer the 9 questions mentioned in the proposal Biggest concern I see here is the time constraint. In a period of mere two months you want to prepare an ideal CS curriculum, deliver to multiple audiences, and gather enough data to establish some pedagogical facts. Also you want to keep all your programming classes voluntary. That looks like a really big task to me! Why not try this approach: 1. Take few core CS concepts (1, 2 or 3 but not more than five) 2. Take a single age group 3. Devise a teaching method and deliver it to the audience 4. Gather feedback. From this feedback establish something or make assumptions 5. Revise teaching approach based on new assumptions and deliver it again to next group of audience 6. Repeat 4 and 5 steps with small variations 7. Present what worked and what not. My idea is that you should focus on one thing at a time. Take one CS concept and present it 5 different ways to same age group and compare the results to find what works best (hands on, slides, lecture, notes, animations, videos etc.)"	10/15/2015 15:13	134

I'm wondering how you will control the survey population to make sure the results are indicative of those who would benefit most. I'm also curious about the end game. That is, do kids who get an introduction to programming through one of these (or other programs) have an increased success in pursuing a career in programming? Also difficult to control for (correlation vs. causation) and probably outside scope, but I thought it was worth mentioning."	10/15/2015 19:05	462	7	
Student53	Student34	2	"This is a pretty cool project, I like how you are leveraging your position in CCA to further improve our program. I think it is well scoped and planned, one thing I was wondering about was the sample size of this test in order to reach conclusions, but you clearly addressed this in the poten[firstname]l problems section. In regards to the data collected, I would consider the survey an important one, this measure is more subjective however for this purpose might be more accurate, how students feel about peer feedback in relation to their grade will provide data for other types of analysis. One more thing I was thinking of is ad[lastname]g a grade the peerfeedback received, but of course would go beyond the scope of this project, it would first need to be implemented by the peer feedback owners."	10/15/2015 19:39	944

On top of that the proposal is very clear, well written, inclu[lastname]g the diagram was specially helpful to understand it without having to reread. Good luck!"	10/15/2015 20:10	736		
Student53	Student6	1	"Hi [firstname], my only feedback would be to elaborate more on the tool description. I like the idea of buil[lastname]g on top of an existing training material, this makes the scope more manageable and improves the likelihood of it being used. I didn't fully grasp how it will differen[firstname]te, but look forward to seeing that once the project is completed. Best!"	10/15/2015 20:23	465	5	
Student14	Student1	1	"Great job Sam. I was able to gain some tips of my own - like utilizing Reddit for survey questions. I think that you have a solid plan for backup, very practical. One of the main drawbacks however, was the number of survey questions. 30-50 sounds like a ton and Im not sure if many people would be willing to do so especially without incentives. Have you thought about raffling a device or gift card for participants? What would happen if you received a large percentage of participants who do not meet your target qualifications?"	10/16/2015 1:24	1765		
Student14	Student22	1	"Great job Team EMOT. For some reason I do not see all of your references in your text, only 1 and 2. Your Calendar is really nice - love the color co[lastname]g."	10/16/2015 1:54	685		
Student14	Student36	1	"Great Job, [firstname]. Do you have any references? I didn't see any listed nor included in the text. My mentor encouraged met to add this info to be properly cleared by the IRB."	10/16/2015 2:05	264	6

Student25	Student74	1	"Hey guys, It was very interesting rea[lastname]g your final proposal on buil[lastname]g an app that focuses on video modeling. I had no clue how powerful observational learning can be effective with kids that have autism. Very well written and put together. Looking forward to seeing the end result!"	10/17/2015 0:28	795		
Student25	Student40	1	"Hey [firstname], Like you, I also work in the IT department at University and completely see the value in the tool you will be buil[lastname]g for your project. Also, the challenges you will face while bringing in the student registration data to track attendance for the student. I think one of the main drivers for attendance is usually financial aid requirements. A lot of instructors resist having to track attendance due to being in a higher ed environment. One method we use to organize class groups is creating individual Active directory groups that also server as distribution groups. The things to look out for is keeping the class enrollment in sync due to drop/add nature. We run our sync tasks daily to account for that. I don�t know if you already have a method in place, but you might be able to knock out a couple of new features by integrating course groups in AD for security permissions, Distribution Lists, and pulling the group membership into your tool. Anyways, hope this helps and good luck!"	10/17/2015 0:41	791		
Student25	Student1	1	"I�ve worked with a lot of non-traditional students at my current job at a University and I see a huge gap between the traditional students vs non-traditional with technology. The fact that most non-traditional students didn�t grow up with technology certainly requires more work for them to catch up to their classmates. I would take a look around at community colleges and access institutions that have Non-Traditional student clubs or groups on seeking answers to your survey questions. Reddit may be a good place, but when dealing with non-traditional students the likelihood of them fin[lastname]g it might be difficult. Feel free to email me the survey and I�ll pass along to the staff that work with non-traditional students at my college. [firstname].[lastname]@ung.edu Good luck!"	10/17/2015 0:58	797		
Student25	Student11	1	"Hey Vu, I really like the idea of students leaving feedback in the Udacity videos. Having the ability to raise your hand or see where other students have raised their hands at certain spots would be more engaging. The historical feedback also gives instructors ideas on possibly provi[lastname]g links for additional information and/or modifying the video to dive more into a particular topic. Looking forward to seeing what you create. Good luck!"	10/17/2015 1:12	360		
Student6	Student54	1	"You did an excellent job of describing the problem space and your plan of attack. The only point that I had an issue with was: ""Secondly, in highly specialized fields the content within each assignment is valuable in its own right and having a contract that explicitly puts complete control of the data in the hands of the institution is a smart decision from a security and ownership standpoint. "" I do not like the idea of giving up control of anything I have created exclusively to any third party organization. I will concede that individuals may have questionable security practices, but I do not believe that institutions are necessarily any better. Overall, a good read. I look forward to seeing your finished product."	10/17/2015 0:42	426		
Student6	Student34	1	"I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your proposal. When I first signed into peer feedback and saw the automata diagram at the start, I immediately thought of you, [firstname], and was pleasantly surprised to be rea[lastname]g your work. My concern (with my admittedly limited knowledge of studies and statistics) is the poten[firstname]l bias in your results, which you do address. Regardless of their motivation to participate in peer feedback, the very act of participating displays something of the nature of the student. Especially considering the dropout rates, I think continuing this work and pulling data over multiple semesters will be of tremendous value, but unfortunately does not help you out this semester. Good luck!"	10/17/2015 0:50	658		
Student6	Student90	1	I learned a lot about dyscalculia in rea[lastname]g your proposal. Are you concerned with the lack of success that others have had in trying to come up with strategies to help kids with dyscalculia? Do you think the ITS will need to function differently if you have primary or secondary dyscalculia? Good luck!	10/17/2015 1:01	638	7	
Student6	Student92	1	Interesting topic. It sounds as if you could have benefited from participating in a team to hopefully accomplish more of your vision. I think the design that you have chosen fits well with the problems that you may or may not encounter. Good luck!	10/17/2015 1:12	244		
Student32	Student2	1	"Hi [firstname], You have presented a very intriguing project indeed! I agree your assessment, that the mobile platform could be an excellent teaching aid to help students attained [lastname]forced knowledge of the subject they'd like to learn via reviews and repetitions. I suspect the most challenging aspect of the application development process will be to populate the database with subject related materials as the instructor would most likely need to spend a significant amount of time developing the course material. On this front, I have a suggestion: since there is a significant time constraint toward completing a working model I found a site where you may be able to populate your application with some test data: http://trec.nist.gov/data/qa.html. On TREC page, towards the bottom, you should find the link to sample QA datasets. I wish you the best of luck and much success! I look forward to seeing your prototype.

Student32	Student20	1	"Gentlemen, This is a fantastic idea! Your proposal reminds me a lot of the Jive Software product (jivesoftware.com) an enterprise-level collaboration application. I love the idea of the sandboxed remote development portal available directly through the application, nice! Your selection of development platform suites are excellent choices for the product, in fact, you've introduced me to a few I wasn't aware of, such as Guacamole and the P2R framework. Although I couldn't find anything regar[lastname]g P2R on the Internet? However, curious that I am, I did a search for similar APIs and found http://openbadges.org which might be another way to incentivize the contributors. Open Badges positions themselves as offering a new online standard to recognize and verify learning.

Student32	Student93	2	"Hi Student93, Your proposal is, by far, the best proposal I've read and I'm not easily impressed; you blew me away with your proposal! You obviously have culminated your skills and education in what will be, undoubtedly, a most re[firstname]able paper! I loved your perfect application of the HMM to gain insight as to the user's current state. DAWA, the ""brains"" behind the analytical engine, utilizing some of the latest ML algorithms and patterns has the poten[firstname]l to gain some very practical predictive capabilities, that at the minimum could be invaluable obtaining unique insights into the user's current state. And more interestingly, how DAWA can interact with the user letting them know of a poten[firstname]l impen[lastname]g [lastname]e in state, alerting them through audible (e.g. sounds, music) or visual (screen flashing (if not epileptic prone) or perhaps some form of an animative image) tools. Of course, you've developed a mathematical method to qualify and quantify the success of DAWA through the use of yet an additional set of statistical tools, very impressive. Although, while rea[lastname]g through these tests and methods one additional tool might be useful, the Kalman Filter (KF). As you've mentioned in your proposal there exists a poten[firstname]l for false positives and other anomalous entries, the KF may help filter these out to get better predictive results; just thought I'd offer the KF in case you didn't have an opportunity to consider this tool. Highly impressed, = Student32 ="	10/17/2015 21:10	1214	7	This is one of most helpful reviews though my skills here are greatly overestimated :)

Student16	Student24	2	"Great job documenting the project.

Student8	Student37	1	I think that this will be a great idea. Bringing these types of things together in a way that will engage a person properly is always key. There are things that feel like a chore and no one wants to do them. Something that can either make it part of the flow or at the very least something worth dealing with could be very valuable I've never dealt with AngularJS yet but I've heard good things. I myself am using mleonJS for a game so I am excited for the use of this type of technology.	10/25/2015 13:12	477		
Student8	Student29	2	"So I had some experience learning Cisco back in high school... it was a waste of time. The class was read these things on some cisco website and then take tests.... and no one wanted to really do it. It was super boring and I don't really remember ANYTHING about it. Not hands on...just boring. I think that people really need to have some form of a engagement and in general I think programming is a better start than networking... although they can be extremely related. Either way, I am excited to see where this comes."	10/25/2015 13:21	449	5	
Student8	Student36	1	This is interesting. There is definitely a need for growth in some areas. There have been times on Stackoverflow where I feel like its not too friendly to newer people...especially when the question you may ask seems to have been asked in slightly different variation and sometimes people assume you are asking that question. I think one thing would be a new tag or something that could help newer people out.	10/26/2015 9:49	10	3	
Student8	Student80	2	"I am not quite sure where to start with this. Fascinating idea here if you can gather the necessary data. I feel like I would need to read over this again to gain a better understan[lastname]g of what is going on. One thing that has definitely increased ( or decreased) my quality of feedback is the quality of the work but maybe more importantly, how interesting the work itself is. For instance, if I am working in a similar area, I tend to find it more likley that I will be able to give better feedback but when the topic just seems boring to me....I find it hard to give real feedback. Still, I usually try to find something I can talk about."	10/26/2015 9:49	1046		
Student34	Student90	0	"I think the proposal would have been stronger if the argument for the project and the coverage of background information had been much more condensed down to the key points. It also seems a little s[lastname]ge and off topic to comment on whether the government was involved in developing the Common Core standards, because I don't see any way that this ties back to the difficulties that certain kids have with grasping what numbers mean. The ba[firstname] here is way off, with a huge amount of information on requirements that perhaps relate to why a tool might be valuable and comparatively very little on the actual nature of a proposed tool or what kind of work is going to be involved with the actual project."	10/27/2015 2:16	368	1	Obviously she cannot grasp the concepts.

Student34	Student92	1	"I think when you talk about a 'study' showing that 72% of people aren't completing Codecademy, it's a real problem that this information seems to come from a poll of people who went on to use another service to try to learn programming. It's not fatal, but it's necessary context if anything is going to rest on that piece of evidence. This is going to be a really interesting project when it's done, but I would have liked to see more information on how the program is going to decide how it should behave in situations where there isn't much data to draw on (which will be constantly the case at first) and how well it's going to be able to cope if retention rates are so low that there's no meaningful indication of success that it can latch onto."	10/27/2015 2:22	288

I think automated essay scoring is probably something people can definitely game, but most people with the right skills to do so probably also automatically have the right skills to get a good score on an essay anyway. It's somewhat a matter of whether they respond by trying to scam the gra[lastname]g tool or if they carry on writing as normal."	10/27/2015 2:32	645	6
