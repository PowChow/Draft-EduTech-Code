Student83	Student41	1	"The proposal hits the necessary elements well. The project looks straightforward and helpful. One thing that isn't clear to me - the proposal states that the SMEs will receive alerts of new questions through a smart phone; will there be an interface for them to use a full computer to respond (if they are nearby one)? The quality of writing [lastname]es dramatically when moving from a computer to a smartphone, so if available a computer interface would be preferable for both the SME (quicker) and the learner (higher quality response). Good luck with the project, it looks like it is set up for success."	9/27/2015 22:52	1990		
Student83	Student15	0	"The project proposal is meant to be a standalone document. As such, relevant content from the previous assignments should be reproduced within the proposal itself, rather than linked to as standalone documents. This looks like an interesting project, but I don't understand enough about it from the proposal as it stands now."	9/27/2015 23:25	494		
Student83	Student74	2	"The intro to this proposal is incredibly effective in highlighting the need for this tool and motivating the project. This is a well organized, complete and detailed document for a meaningful and seemingly well scoped project. Best of luck in seeing this through to completion and ultimately deployment."	9/27/2015 23:33	1298		
Student83	Student96	1	"The way that relevant research was woven through the proposal is neat and helped support the document well. Is the toolset to support this community something that you have been buil[lastname]g, or something you started buil[lastname]g at the beginning of the course? Best wishes with the new baby."	9/27/2015 23:55	1587		
Student40	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], This sounds like it'll be a fun project :-). As I was rea[lastname]g through it, and you mentioned the E-Advising part of things, it reminded me of some of the ini[firstname]tives the California Community College system has been pushing the last several years and which caused us to implement a piece of software called DegreeWorks (from Ellucian, which integrates with the Banner SIS, also made by Ellucian...both of these products seem to be used by Georgia Tech and are also used at my workplace too at Imperial Valley College). DegreeWorks, like most EDU software that has its roots in the earlier web days, is a complicated mess of XSLT files, database procedures generating HTML output, and Frames...lots of Frames! (their UI design is really bad, with everything getting generated in multiple frames). The most interesting part of it though, is a process called ""Scribing"". Essen[firstname]lly, it's a custom domain specific language used by people in the Admissions department (at least for us, it might be located in a different department on other campuses) that allows them to ""Scribe"" the offerings in any given Catalog year (so for example, the more recent [lastname]es to our OMSCS program reducing the number of credits to 30 instead of the the original 36 would require a separate Scribe block for this new catalog year). This information then gets ingested/[lastname]slated by the DegreeWorks application and used when Degree Audits, What-ifs, etc. get created in the system. Very recently, the California Community College system has decided to move forward with a pilot of a DegreeWorks alternative from a company called Hobsons: http://www.hobsons.com/education-trends/news-room/media-releases/california-community-colleges-begin-deployment-of-new-academic-advising-and (I don't have any experience with it, so I can't tell you if it's any better...but I hope there are at least less frames used in this product :-). I mainly share this information to demonstrate that the problem itself can actually be a bit more complicated than you originally think due to the [lastname]ing information depen[lastname]g on the catalog year (and I don't truly understand it myself, I've just been on the periphery of its usage here on campus). All in all though, a program like this that could be used by OMSCS students (and possibly made gen[firstname]ally enough where it could be applied to other degree programs) would be wonderful since I could see it as being useful not just for ourselves in the program, but possibly other institutions as well (there aren't very many players in this space so it could actually turn into a poten[firstname]l business...the fact that you'd be using Ruby on Rails and other more modern web development techniques is already a big plus compared to DegreeWorks, and possibly the Hobsons solution too). Good luck in the coming weeks!"	9/27/2015 23:53	1843		
Student40	Student43	1	"Hi [firstname]! I got a kick out of this one :-). First off, it's cool you own a bar! And second, every now and again (when I feel like having or making my own drink) I wonder about barten[lastname]g and learning about all of those neat drink making skills (just yesterday, I was researching some additional uses for Worcestershire Sauce and saw a mention of using it to make a Bloody Mary that made me want to have one, lol). I think your thoughts and approach on this are spot on with exactly the types of purposes and applications we're going to be seeing evolve over the next several years as VR equipment, such as the Oculus Rift, become available to more people/organizations. There's nothing like actually being able to ""do"" something to build up the needed muscle memory for how a task needs to get done, but sometimes real life can be a bit limiting in that regard and being able to replay the same simulation again and again in a VR environment seems like it would be a lot more cost effective (and just effective in general) if the simulation was designed well. It definitely seems like the most challenging piece of the project will actually be buil[lastname]g up all of the objects needed to properly simulate the bar environment, so hopefully that part of the project doesn't hit too many snags, but it seems if you have all of the objects, the rest of it will come from you designing the simulations and tasks you want your people to be able to learn in the VR environment. I hope you're successful so maybe I can get this app later when I'm able to get my own Oculus Rift and maybe learn how to make some more drinks :-). Good luck!"	9/28/2015 0:23	685	6	
Student40	Student8	1	"Hi Chris! Thanks for sharing the MelonJS link! I'll see if I might be able to use that project in conjunction with the PHP/MySQL class I'm teaching at the moment and bring in some game elements (and tie them with server side co[lastname]g for my students). An interesting thing you mentioned at the beginning of your proposal to me was ""However, students with Autism tend to lack the ability to generalize what they learned to contexts other than what is described in the story"". I think the interesting thing to note here is that generalizing can also be a difficult thing for regular students too (e.g. I find this especially prevalent in the two programming classes the college has me teach occasionally, where we'll go over specific programming topics, but then the students have a really difficult time generalizing these concepts so they can create their own solutions). Associating the concepts you presented into a game format is interesting because it makes me wonder if similar approaches could also help regular students learn other concepts (such as programming) better too (essen[firstname]lly opening up the applications for this approach to a much wider audience). (Which kind of makes me think of Cognitive Science and how it focuses on the wide range of ""learning how we learn"" concepts). I think this is a really cool project that has some neat applications if the results come out as expected (once some autistic students are able to try it out and you can verify that it's producing the desired results)...I hope it works out as expected!"	9/28/2015 0:35	1327		
Student40	Student7	1	"Hi Ben! I was just thinking that your name is the same as one of my roommates at Berkeley back in the day (he was a Physics/Econ major, and even though he wasn't a Computer Science guy, I think his Econ knowledge helped him get a position crunching numbers at Google for a time...I need to check-in and see what he's up to these days). Since I have some familiarity with your project/proposal already I don't have much to add on this one, aside from mentioning that I'd be happy to help assist with Alpha testing once the time comes up! Feel free to email me at Student40 when needed :-). Definitely interested in seeing how it develops over the coming weeks!"	9/28/2015 0:57	664

Student44	Student95	1	You presented well documented research plan. I could not find any opportunities to improve it. Good luck w/ the execution!	9/28/2015 6:23	179		
Student44	Student24	1	"[firstname]: Your research area is interesting to me because I specialize in group/team development activities as well as process optimization. Your research combines both of these concepts. Overall, I thought you presented a well-organized concept and research plan. I have no recommendations for improvement. So nice job on the assignment, and good luck w/ the execution. As an aside, I have two comments regar[lastname]g the content of your research. 1. I recommend you drop the gender datum from your survey to ensure there is no bias. If students do have a preference on gender (and some will), that will introduce a gender bias in selection opportunities. Not a good thing these days. Men and women from all cultures need to be able to work together on teams. Better to avoid it completely IMO. As far as the argument that some individuals actually have gender preferences (which I would also argue is a bias), better they work out their issues in school than ignore it and have problems later in the work place. 2. In your paper you list ""Similar skill set/s, common interests"" as a key factor. Recommend you drop the word ""similar"" from this string. It is important to know key attributes of individuals, however the paring for teams may be best accomplished with complementary skills and points of view, and not similar. In my experience, it is not good when everyone on the team has the same skills. Can you imagine a football team where all 11 players possess the skills of a quarterback. Not a good thing. It is best when members of a team have complimentary/different skills, perspectives, etc. For example, in my CS-6440 course this term I am managing a 4 member team developing a software project. The project involves: a. Developing a backend database and supporting software b. Patient facing mobile app c. Patient support group facing app Given these requirements, my team composition requirements are: project manager, software developer w/ backend skills, and two software developers w/ mobile app skills. With any other combination of skills, it would be difficult to complete the project. I appreciate the opportunity to provide input to your work. Great job!"	9/28/2015 6:26	1960	7	Great Suggestions [firstname]. Greatly appreciate your feedback. I had the similar thoughts about the Gender attribute and whether to include in my list for matching criteria. I will carry most of your suggestion and improve on those [lastname]es. Thanks
Student44	Student50	1	"You presented a thorough and detailed research plan. I enjoyed rea[lastname]g it and find no opportunities to improve your research plan at this time. Stay the course and good luck in the execution phase. As a bonus, I have one recommendation to help improve the content of your paper. Recommend you move the last paragraph in your background section (i.e., ""At bare minimum, we can seek to provide retention statistics for the OMSCS program that are on par with those available about MOOCs. Ideally, however, we�ll be able to analyze acquired data and seek out key predictors of attrition (or otherwise causally link variables and shortterm outcomes). Depen[lastname]g on the quality and quantity of data acquired, this could be at the course level, program level, or both. As a stretch goal, we�ll explore the creation of a predictive model that�ll aid in identifying students at risk of dropping out.""), to the beginning of your background information and goals section. It is very important to clearly state in the first paragraph what you are going to do (i.e., what the paper is all about). This provides context for the background information that follows. If you don't do that, the reader is not sure what context the material was written for until the very last paragraph in your introduction. It makes a huge difference in understan[lastname]g. Because of the current order of your material, I actually had to read your background section 2x to make sure I had the correct context for everything you presented. Great job overall!"	9/28/2015 6:59	597	6

Student94	Student34	1	i think peer feedback in such a class would only be helpful if it was done before actual submission of assignments.

Student10	Student68	1	"Some thoughts as I go through this: - You presented your objective and purpose really well - I feel like I have a good understan[lastname]g of what you want to work on. - The term ""computer science training"" seems s[lastname]ge - I wouldn't call an algebra class ""algebra training"". Is the goal training, or education? - I like your list of questions, but one risk that I see is confoun[lastname]g factors given the short time to do this study. You can only optimize one variable at a time, so how can you tell whether humor is having the positive effect, or the classroom activities? It could be for example that humor has a negative effect that is offset by some other factor that is going well. - What does success mean for students? Is the goal to raise a low water[firstname] in the class (ie. help everyone) or that a few students go on to be very successful in computer science? - The timeline for this study seems like it will be very long - it takes a generation to see if an educational method works. What short term metrics can you use for ini[firstname]l analysis? And what is your baseline? It seems very likely that this ultimately has no effect (not a criticism of you - most scientific studies end without a result), but then the question is, how can you tell? - Be careful to have an in-sample and out of sample set when testing your hypotheses - it's easy to over fit! Overall I think that this will be an interesting project. I think that you would benefit from tightening up and defining what you are looking for (I realize that's part of doing research). Good work!"	9/28/2015 8:19	688		
Student10	Student94	1	"Some thoughts as I go through this: - Grammar/capitalization/spelling - iPad, Montessori, etc., should be capitalized properly, ""learningj"" spelled incorrectly. - How is Montessori supposed to help students perform better socio-economically? What does that mean? - Why are physical tools NOT technological tools? What defines a technological tool? - Not sure that MathBlaster really has no benefits - video games in education have proven to be valuable before. Part of the way that people learn is by doing a lot of problems after all. - How do you get some statistical certainty from your results? Presumably some students will do well/poorly regardless of the method of learning, so how will you know that your results are statistically significant? - Likewise, it seems that the time horizon for this study will be quite a bit longer than the semester - what early results do you think that you can record? - Overall I think a big challenge for this will be scope. How do you isolate the effect that you want to learn about? Another thing that might be worth thinking about is using technology for teachers to help facilitate learning. Khan Academy has done some re[firstname]able things in this area - one of their ideas is to let teachers monitor students progress, but instead of immediately helping out struggling students, to assign stronger students to help the weaker students. This sounds similar to the Montessori approach, actually. Here is a good overview of what they are trying to do: https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res/k12-classrooms"	9/28/2015 8:31	1738		
Student10	Student65	1	"It looks like you have spent a lot of time thinking about this project. Have you read about spaced repetition learning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) - I've used it personally as a study aid to great effect. It's not good at introducing new knowledge, however it's invaluable for enforcing existing knowledge. Anki (https://ankiweb.net/) is an open-source platform for that. Some things that you might want to consider (maybe beyond the scope of this assignment - just things that came to mind rea[lastname]g it). - How will you know if this software is succee[lastname]g? - Are you trying to optimize for people succee[lastname]g on the tests, or for learning? It seems that these two goals will be in conflict at time. I think that you touched on some ""meta"" problems such as buil[lastname]g test taking skills, but is there also a learning approach to it? - It wasn't clear what you mean by being able to schedule questions to open/close. - Could the tool be used to help identify areas where students are struggling? For example, someone might be doing well on knowledge of the material (ie. getting questions right) but struggling on doing so in the time bounds. - Another neat area could be generating questions from existing templates, so you have an unlimited number of questions. I'm guessing the AP tests [lastname]e with time, so how relevant are historical questions? Finally, Khan Academy has a really nice page talking about integrating (their) technology into a learning program (https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res). Maybe not directly applicable, but I think that you might find some interesting ideas there. This sounds like a really worthwhile idea - best of luck!"	9/28/2015 11:36	680	7	
Student10	Student34	2	"This is a very well done report - you've covered the problem that you're solving, you're analyzing a single problem and you have good backup plans in case parts don't work out. I'd be really interested to see the results - I took CCA two semesters ago, and thought it was a pretty good course, but I have a pretty strong background in the area of algorithms and computability. I definitely thought that the course would be very difficult for people without any previous courses in the area. One thing that would be important is for you to have a control group as well as a test group, to avoid over-fitting to the data. I wish that I had some deeper feedback to give though - but it seems that you've spent a good amount of time thinking this through. Great work, very interested to see your results."	9/28/2015 12:50	563		
Student8	Student7	1	"This is awesome. As someone who enjoys programming, I have come across those blocks myself and in some situations still find myself there. Things like Codecademy are awesome, but they leave you hanging when it comes to the real deep concepts that are really used. As I've learned, not everything is just a file of functions but usually it involves classes or objects or whatever your language calls them. I think getting deeper into real meaningful topics that go beyond pure syntax is something that is missing and something like that would be greatly welcome. Perhaps someone can take inspiration from your project and then apply it to things such as Android."	9/28/2015 9:08	599		
Student8	Student81	1	"The only thing I would like to see more of is how it directly relates to Educational Technology. It seems to me that it is mostly focused on the Military. Having said that, I also do understand the point of how things bleed over from Government programs such as the military, or in many cases Nasa, into the private world. Is there anyway to directly relate what should happen with the US Army to the Educational Side? On a side note, not sure if it was intended or if it was the font, but there were times where it looks like a space was put in between numbers. From what I've been told this one should be more refined than some of our other works although in the end it doesn't matter to me because I mainly want content. Either way, interesting topic."	9/28/2015 9:18	13	7	
Student8	Student73	1	"I feel like this could be something important in the future. If you started out early then It really wasn't that needed as with only a few courses to pick from, someone of the quality of an OMSCS student should be able to figure this out. However, with MANY classes coming down the pipeline it can definitely be helpful to have something like this. For instance, I could see myself getting distracted with ""fun classes"". Maybe some classes that seem interesting but are outside of my specialty. That could help insure students graduate on time. I know for me it was something I thought I was going to get in trouble with but luckily I can still have my fun classes..unless more come out, haha."	9/28/2015 9:26	874		
Student8	Student60	1	"By far the best laid out proposal I have read and this is the last of my four. I can really talk to the need for some way to really have a group to participate with. I am in 6300. While email works... it would have been nice if we had a better way to talk. Sure we could do everything on Github..but still not enough. Its not as good as me and the three other guys being close together. As a side note, I would also advise that every question you ask in your survey be as specific as possible. That way people are more likely to be together in groups that make sense. Technically speaking I do think that it is important to make sure skills match. Although another issue is related to what I've experienced..just because you put people together who each have a unique set doesn't mean they will want to use that set. That isn't a bad thing to have happen...but it can also be a pain in the fact that someone who is the best programmer tries to be the PM and in the end they don't like the code so they end up editing it and doing the work of others. Whiles it is fine to do things that you are not familiar with, I do find it annoying when those who could make everyone else's lives easier do not. Either way, I guess those are things you can think about..but overall I think you have a great foundation."	9/28/2015 9:41	4217	7	The feedback is right on the [firstname].

Student1	Student77	1	"This is an interesting concept. Will the app only work on iPhones or will it also work on iPads? I could see using this on a tablet, or on an iPhone plus, but not on the smaller screen sizes. Also, making your ini[firstname]l test group iOS only will reduce the poten[firstname]l pool of test users. Have you considered doing a responsive web app first?"	9/28/2015 12:17	457		
Student1	Student18	1	How is this different from using the typical 1 to 5 scale on a survey? I don't understand how this is radically different approach.

Student1	Student54	1	"Other than hi[lastname]g the results from students, is there anything that makes your system ""smarter"" than the rest? I've used turnitin.com as an instructor before, and I was able to spot plagiarism that it couldn't. For example, does your system detect [lastname]es in writing style from one assignment to the next? Or if I suspect plagiarism on an assignment, can I submit other text samples from that student and see if there is a difference in writing style, such as type/complexity of words used, grammar, etc? These two features would be really useful, just my two cents."	9/28/2015 12:30	527		
Student1	Student37	1	"Interesting concept, but how is this different from something like Stack Overflow? Who selects the host organization's ""best and brightest"" and what is the criteria? Age, education, past experience, or something else? Who would vet the technologies to make sure they are something useful in that enterprise space? For example, if the shop primarily uses one technology stack (LAMP) what work related value would there be to deploying education on technologies outside of that stack? Also, beyond managerial and HR directives, what would be the incentive for established workers to add yet another work related task during their ""free time""?"	9/28/2015 12:39	2198		
Student35	Student46	1	"I think you have done a good job outlining your proposal concisely. It would definitely be useful to have a game that covers the topic you're interested in. And it sounds like you have a good idea of how the game will evolve in various stages and what the stages would look like, from inception to delivery. You may find it useful to segment your proposal into sections, though. Also, explicitly listing related edtech games and doing a more detailed comparison against them might help the reader in getting an idea of where these solutions fail and where your program would succeed (you might have already covered this area in your prior assignments, though).

Student35	Student72	1	"The proposal does a very good job of outlining project tasks and the correspon[lastname]g due dates.

Student35	Student82	1	"Your proposal does a good of describing your project plan. Provi[lastname]g a calendar with task and deadlines helped me in understan[lastname]g the work ahead and the scope of the project. Also, mentioning details about your data set (KBAI student assignments) helped me contextualize the underlying problem better. My only minor suggestion would be to perhaps discuss ""skip thought vectors"" (and related work) in more technical detail (I'm not sure if you already did this in previous assignments, though). I found the paper you have cited to be interesting (skip thought vector paper [3]), and I look forward to seeing your project implementation."	9/28/2015 13:13	749	5	
Student35	Student49	2	"The level of detail in your proposal is amazing. I like how the proposal has outlined the project schedule, technology stack, and division of responsibilities among team members. My only minor suggestion would be to add a mock screenshot or two.

Even now, I think at best it is marginal. However, I'm sure people who suffer from this condition have a hard time both in the workforce and in the classroom. It would be helpful to articulate their challenges and be made aware of the best methods to handle these individuals so that they can achieve their educational goals. The charts are really clear, a lot is said in such a simple format. However, generally speaking, I find clinical trials with actual students to be more compelling rather than just a model of the condition. Both are useful, and maybe models are best before moving forward to trials. Good luck!"	9/28/2015 13:39	855	6	"I need to be more motivating about why modeling is better that clinical trials.

Knowledge [lastname]sfer systems for IT Departments already exist (but their use and usefulness vary widely), which I believe is the core problem and you are proposing a solution that has the ability to motivate employees to use the software. If the end goal is to [lastname]sfer information from one employee to another, then I can see how this would marginally apply to EdTech, but is a stretch to do so. Interesting proposal though.

Student19	Student35	2	"I like how well organized your proposal is. I would be very interested to see the outcome of your project. One thing that wasn't clear to me is (or maybe I missed it), is how will you run analysis on code? Particularly, things like ABC analysis, code coverage, etc. which are very language specific. It looks like the ini[firstname]l version of your tool will be focusing on Java code analysis as a starting point but I wasn't sure if that was your plan. There's a tool named Hound, which is not particularly aimed at education but it does provide some basic code linting/analysis for multiple languages: https://houndci.com. I thought you might find it beneficial as you develop your tool. GitHub also very recently came up with a classroom tool: https://classroom.github.com that might be worth looking into. This definitely sounds like a fun project. I'm very interested and intrigued to see how you continue to work on it. Best of luck!! :-)"	9/28/2015 13:58	1946		
Student96	Student101	1	"This seems like a great project. Your comment about teachers getting dependent on technologies is interesting. Good luck putting it together. Sorry if I missed it, but how are you selecting teachers for inclusion in the survey?"	9/28/2015 14:33	266	7	
Student96	Student41	1	"Your project sounds very good. I like that you are considering both LivePerson and Twilio as delivery options. I could see both being very useful. I'm curious to see how it turns out and if it ends up being used in a real course. I imagine the real challenge will be on the one staffing the support line. As someone on the other end, it can be challenging to receive all of the interruptions."	9/28/2015 14:38	332		
Student96	Misc3	1	"Wow! This is very ambitious. Though it seems like you have a development plan under way. My only recommendations are to include a level of graphic ""prettiness"" so it looks as impressive as I'm sure the code will end up being. I'm also curious how the simplified physics engine will end up. That's something that could get very complicated. Though I suspect you have that sorted out given the great design materials you put together. I worked on a similar project many years ago for simulations. Each project was custom but allowed students to interact with a simulated device. We basically just had a number of views and then variables for the different states. It was curious how much complexity we could encode in those few things. Ex: cable 1 plugged into socket 2, etc. The hard part was making 3d models and handling all of the states intelligently from all angles."	9/28/2015 14:43	380		
Student96	Student6	1	Great project! I'm really excited to see what you come up with. Your writeup stands out amongst the others that I read by being very clear and I can imagine it being very successful and useful. Good luck!	9/28/2015 14:50	160	5	
Student39	Student3	1	"I would be a bit more specific with the proposal, especially when it comes to the tasks. When you say focus on Educational Leadership, will you be researching various implementations, interviewing leaders, looking at case studies? What deliverable do you hope to obtain for yourself? Setting up milestones is important to create an obtainable project."	9/28/2015 15:27	888	5	Working on the Draft.
Student39	Student92	1	"Make sure to proofread the proposal before the final draft. The tasks need to built out a bit more, inclu[lastname]g the class assignments. Describe the implementation, inclu[lastname]g technologies stack. Does seem like a lot of work for just one person. I think it's a good start, but should definitely be more fleshed out."	9/28/2015 15:44	678		
Student39	Student28	2	You definitely broke out the parts of a proposal into meaningful chunks. Your weekly schedule is on point with obtainable goals. I couldn't really find anything to improve.	9/28/2015 15:56	850	6	
Student39	Student38	1	"First, I like your problem scope. Make sure you add the class assignments to your schedule."	9/28/2015 16:10	606	7	had forgotten to include the class assignments - thanks for the timely reminder
Student80	Student40	1	"I like the inclusion of an abstract; I will do that on my next draft. I would modify your abstract, keeping it brief, but ad[lastname]g a bit more about your project. Specifically, add a sentence on why you are doing the project, and what you expect to accomplish. ""Provi[lastname]g better tools for faculty"" is pretty vague, and the project seems extensive. How will you measure progress and success? What items would you drop if they become problematic, and what items are a critical minimum? What criteria were used for selection of the attendance tool features. Would it be feasible to do a small survey this semester? As an instructor, one feature I have always wished for is predictive attendence. It would be nice if, when I opened the page, it had already filled in the expected attendence, and I only had to make minor adjustments. However, my format is open, and people have flexibility on which class they go to, so I don't have a set roster. Will it be mobile friendly? The web page tool has been given minimal coverage. What will its features be? The inclusion of hours in the schedule is a thoughtful way to aim at the target for the class. Will you be able to work on this during your ""day job"" since you're doing it for them? 30 minutes seems like an underestimate of the status checks. I'd time the first one and see how it goes. Feel free to post your results for the rest of us! I assume, because you've allocated around 10 hours to the project, that you expect to spend 12-15 hours total per week due to other class deliverables such as peer feedback and ""class participation""? If not, you may wish to scale down your project hours so you aren't overwhelmed. On the final draft, I would not include past assignment as appendices. Per Dr Joyner in @373 ""the proposal is intended to be complete: the reader should not need access to your previous assignments to understand your proposal."""	9/28/2015 15:26	4473	1	"All great input Student80! Thank you very much for your suggestions (I'll try and incorporate all of that into my final version :-). I do feel I skimped on the details in certain areas as you pointed (mainly because they had been covered previously), but I should make an effort to consolidate and bring all of that information into the full proposal probably more cohesively. I liked the predictive attendance idea :-)!"
Student80	Student97	1	"How do non-information security businesses handle the ""arms race"" (eg law enforcement, retail shrinkage mitigation, actual arms races with physical weapons). Could you utilize any of these approaches? (CEUs?) What about the non-security information races? Technology moves fast, and non-security IT professionals have to keep up as well. What works in those industries? What kind of academic research has been done on the subject? What variables will influence the success of your project? What unknowns are involved? If you have to reduce scope, what will you drop? How will you measure success?"	9/28/2015 16:40	563		
Student80	Student53	1	"What are the total hours you intend to put into the project? There are three team members, at 7 hours a week and 10 weeks (exclu[lastname]g finals week/slack time!), that means about 210 hours. That leaves time for non-project class activities. I tried to add up the hours in your document and I got 310. Do you plan to spend 10 hours per week on the project? How many hours will spend on all class activities per week? I like the notation of hours. It might be a bit easier to track as a table. What fallbacks do you have when things don't go accor[lastname]g to plan? What external dependencies do you have? How will you measure success? What is the minimum application you are willing to deliver, and what features can you drop? I think the goal is worthy, but I'm not sure exactly what you plan to deliver. Perhaps some simple use cases or walkthroughs would help. How will this tool behave in a child's hands?"	9/28/2015 16:50	855		
Student80	Student63	1	"Per Dr Joyner in @373, ""the proposal is intended to be complete: the reader should not need access to your previous assignments to understand your proposal."" Referencing past assignments doesn't help clarify your proposal. More references to external research would be helpful. What is the most important feature of this project? What would you be willing to drop if you run out of time. What external dependencies could hinder your progress? What content will you use to test the app? What platform will it run on and how will people use it? What will you deliver at the end of the semester? I imagine your project would be improved if classmates can download and try it during development. What media assets will the game require (if it's going to be in pygame, will you include sound and graphics and, if so, will they be self-created or external. If not, what is the value of pygame?)"	9/28/2015 17:16	493		
Student43	Student60	1	"It looks like you have a good handle on what you want to do and I can see the value in having a tool like this. I think you should include some mention on if you see this being integrated into a platform such as T-Square or Udacity, or if it will always be stand-alone."	9/28/2015 18:09	7	6	I got some insight around what more to include in my next submission.
Student43	Student8	1	"In general, as a draft, this meets my expectations. I think it gives a good idea of what you intend to accomplish. For your final proposal, I'd double check some of your formatting, for instance the mixed lea[lastname]g capitalization of your task list and also include your total hours. I don't know your level of development skill but it seemed to me that some of your hour estimates may be a bit low. You may be spot on but make sure you're giving yourself enough time."	9/28/2015 18:09	2027		
Student43	Student7	1	It seems you have a good handle on what you want to accomplish and it seems doable within this semester timeframe. I'm curious what your opinion is of something like CodeSchool's iOS class (https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ios) and if it has any bearing on what you're doing.	9/28/2015 18:43	1059		
Student43	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname]. I think this could be very useful for us OMSCS students. I find myself constantly readjusting my schedule based on the available specializations and the latest addition of classes and I would assume many others are doing the same. I think you have a good handle on what you're doing and have a reasonable plan. The main concern I have for this is how will this advisement be impacted by class availability? As a user, I'd find it frustrating to get a suggested schedule of classes but then be unable to register for those classes b/c they're full. So it might be useful to consider a way to quickly adjust that schedule if I find a class already booked."	9/28/2015 23:42	1152	6	I agree - my mentor also proposed allowing adjustments. I'm currently thinking through a couple options - 1. auto schedule but allow adjustments 2. using a wizard to allow buil[lastname]g the schedule
Student29	Student4	1	"Good paper. I was curious as to how they would gain the basic skills to implement an empty API, but then you made clear that you are targeting students that have taken a programming language but not a data structures component. Would this poten[firstname]lly be another step of the curriculum?"	9/28/2015 18:34	181		
Student29	Student79	1	"Good content. I'm personally not a fan of the screenshots but perhaps it shows your focus better. Schedule, content, citations all were good. I'd like to see the finished product."	9/28/2015 18:37	275	6	
Student29	Student20	1	"This is a pretty good idea. Your thoughts about industry echo mine. I wonder if the scope is too large for a 2 month effort, however. Good luck!"	9/28/2015 18:42	321		
Student29	Student75	1	I would like to use this tool! Great breakdown of tasks and identifying risks. Good luck. Great diagram and fallback plans.	9/28/2015 18:47	157	5	Thanks!
Student17	Student11	1	"I think that your project is certainly extremely intriguing. I also think that your scope is appropriate as a project in this course. Allowing students do pinpoint discussions on specific topics within a lecture would certainly be more ideal than our current system. Another possible existing solution that may have similar aspects is Codecademy. However, it is not as elaborate as what you are proposing. Their solution allows its students to click on an engagement button that sends them to that particular topic or subject within a discussion forum. Looking forward to how your product turns out."	9/28/2015 18:46	348		
Student17	Student16	1	"I would have liked to see more detail on how you will be buil[lastname]g the application. I am not sure which platforms or tools you will be using. Even so, your idea is extremely intriguing. Further accessibility to learning materials on all platforms would certainly allow students to learn on the go. It would be a great tool to incorporate with GT's OMSCS as well."	9/28/2015 19:44	180	5	
Student17	Student84	1	"I think that your concept is intriguing. However, it may prove challenging to get large datasets from parents. Additionally, the dataset that you will be receiving from parents may already be a focused demographic that is specific to parents willing to participate. Low-income families and those with limited access to the internet may not be as available to participate. Even so, I think that your tool is intriguing and look forward to seeing your work. The calendar and details of your implementation were very detailed."	9/28/2015 19:47	228	6	raises a good point.. we'll discuss in discussions.
Student17	Student36	1	"Hi [firstname], As you acknowledged in your paper, it looks like your project is a major undertaking. I am not sure if I missed it, but I would recommend you using time as a way of organizing your data as well. As platforms progress and [lastname]e, the way that users communicate on different platforms develop as well. I would also investigate reddit if possible. Although it may be a little more wild-west/cowboy than some of the other platforms, there's generally a wealth of information on reddit where users can generally look to for support. Even so, that would only increase the amount of scope on your project which would likely be too much. Interested to see where your work goes."	9/29/2015 15:54	380	5	
Student79	Student61	1	I'm having a hard time understan[lastname]g the value add. It seems that the tool is not going to make any lessons but interface with lessons already provided. So how would this make my job of learning a language easier?	9/28/2015 20:00	349	5	I added a value added section outlining what code-grater offers
Student79	Student4	1	"It seems that you are actually trying to accomplish 2 things: 1. A framework for teaching students and presenting programming problems 2. A curriculum that focuses on Top-down instead of bottom up I agree with your problem premise. And additionally that students often don't have experience developing massive projects that need to continue to be maintainable. But I'm not sure that a new platform/framework needs to be created to [lastname]e the way this is taught. I think the 2 goals are perpendicular and in the given time frame, probably best to pick one."	9/28/2015 20:06	410		
Student79	Student75	1	"I like the idea. Are you interfacing directly with existing tech/planning? Have you contacted administrators who would use your application? It would be nice if the system was fairly open and could be applied to other courses at GT, or even other universities."	9/28/2015 20:13	182	5	"Yes, it would be nice if we can have discussion with the end users. I have mentioned part of the plan (UAT, feedback). Let's see. Thanks!"
Student79	Student20	1	"Seems very ambitious, but well detailed. My biggest concern is the people/business side of the equation. Who will be trying out this system? It seems there needs to be a corporate commitment to [lastname]e strategy and invest in teams. The tool might help, but it seems more of a business process [lastname]e."	9/28/2015 20:16	295		
Student24	Student19	1	"[firstname], I think your proposal clearly identifies the problem domain and target audience. There seems to be a definitive void when it comes to creating visual learning tools for 5 - 12 age group. Either the focus is on entertainment aspect or most seem too childish for that age group. By the time kids start going to middle school they are smart enough to figure out things on their own. Having a learning tool which challenges them to think while they are playing will be very helpful in improving problem solving skill at an early age. Your design steps demonstrate that you have a clear understan[lastname]g of the scope of project and how to accomplish within the schedule time. Think about ad[lastname]g a high level design view or a data model which captures the essence of your workflow. Also ad[lastname]g some wire-frame layout mock-ups of the solution you are envisioning might add more depth to your proposal. I think you are on track to a great project."	9/28/2015 20:47	388	7	
Student24	Student50	1	"[firstname], I think you have clearly identified the existing phenomena with MOOC and the scope of your research based on the availability of data sources. Your methodology demonstrates that you have a good understan[lastname]g of the underlying paradigm. I totally understand your dilemma in fin[lastname]g the student data for carrying out any valuable research. We ran into this issues in one of my previous class. Usually OMSCS administration is not willing to share sensitive student information unless insisted by the instructor and even then they will release the de-identified data for the students. You might have better luck since the course is research based. As an alternative (backup) I will suggest taking a look at these resources to aggregate some data for your study if it helps. http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html http://er.educause.edu/articles/2014/12/mooc-completion-and-retention-in-the-context-of-student-intent http://er.educause.edu/articles/2013/6/retention-and-intention-in-massive-open-online-courses-in-depth https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/709735/Cheung_georgetown_0076M_12632.pdf?sequence=1 Also here is an example survey format (from SurveyMonkey) which you might find useful for creating your own survey questionnaire. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/?sm=njqxPaZRjebJzve52uASeg%3D%3D"	9/28/2015 20:53	391	6	
Student24	Student56	2	"[firstname], Your overview aptly highlights the deficiencies in the current Standardized testing system and a need to compare with alternate forms of assessments to measure students level of retention of knowledge. Since your research is going to rely on preexisting texts and studies, you might want to considered the authenticity of these resources. Your project scope is ""to present and resolve the argument of Standardized Testing vs. Stealth and Game Based Assessment. "" I think you have done an excellent job of defining the set of questions and as you mentioned each question can serve as a �stand-alone� research paper on its own. Although I must admit that rea[lastname]g through your narration it sounds like you have already formulated your opinion that other forms of assessments are better in compares to Standardized tests. Sometimes it creates a bias when you are trying to answer your own questions, weather you are in fact trying to advocate for a certain type of assessment being better instead of presenting the case from both sides. It might also be worthwhile to explore another form of computer-based test system that is gaining some momentum. Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) - some references which might be useful. http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2013/3/20%20education%20technology%20success%20west%20bleiberg/Download%20the%20paper.pdf http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/jets/article/viewFile/101/116"	9/28/2015 21:00	597	7	
Student24	Student58	1	"The goal of your study is to ""determine the factors that predict a student�s success within a Georgia Institute of Technology OMSCS Course"" I think you have presented a good ini[firstname]l list of educational technology related factors which might shed some light on successful student behavior in OMSCS courses. I believe there are many other factors that might contribute to a students success or failure within OMSCS program which might prove to be very difficult at aggregating any data unless additional survey is carried out. Have you considered the external factors that might be influencing this behavior like number of classes a student is taking during the same time they were enrolled in KBAI class or the average time spent on doing coursework per class on weekly basis. If the study is going to focus on KBAI class specifically, the factors like students prior understan[lastname]g of the topic or the prerequisite requirements like knowledge of programming languages or background in CS field. I have taken multiple classes myself so from that experience I can confirm the time and effort that goes into taking one class versus taking 2 or 3 classes at t he same time is a major factor in getting a grade of A or B in simultaneous classes. I think for proving the validity of your research, having insufficient data might be a big hurdle to climb. But you have a great team for managing most of those challenges. I see great poten[firstname]l and value in your study."	9/29/2015 19:14	662		
Student11	Student32	2	"I think you guys did a great job with the functional requirements breakdown. One thing I would look at is perhaps prioritizing the list to ""must haves"" and ""nice to haves"". These may all be necessary though, I don't know. I think there's a good breakdown of tasks and deliverables. I am a bit worried that [firstname]y may have too much on his plate, but I don't think it's a crazy amount of work. All in all, good work here."	9/28/2015 18:52	8619		
Student11	Student86	2	"I had no idea there were two teachers. So I'd recommend expan[lastname]g the methodology section and talk about [firstname] & [firstname] and their classrooms/students. Asides from that, I think it's really cool that you guys are doing a project that is incorporating real work. I'd consider publishing and perhaps sharing the curriculum developed."	9/28/2015 21:15	813		
Student11	Student76	2	"I think you have a good grasp on the project and have done a good job of breaking it down into tasks as well as setting manageable expectations for a semester of work. How much experience do you have working with the Kinect and with ML? I think getting the hardware part functioning properly and interfacing with your software is the most difficult piece due to the number of moving parts, so I think it was wise to put that first. Could you build against pre-recorded video and train your algorithms against that?"	9/28/2015 21:29	1223	7	
Student11	Student2	1	"I would shift the sections around a bit. I'd move the schedule and task list to the end of the document. I think it takes too long to find out what the problem is and what the proposed solution is. I'm actually still unclear on what the actual solution is asides from using free time to brush up on school work. I didn't get a chance to read your elevator pitch, but I think you should perhaps incorporate that or parts of it in the overview."	9/28/2015 21:49	2800		
Student88	Student10	1	"Very well thought out problem, however I think your scope seems a little too big. Doing a full website + a browser plugin seems rather ambitious. Your own proposed solution suggested this as a long term plan. For the web hosting, I would suggest Amazon Cloud or something similar, as students we get a discount on many of these types of sites. Also for your schedule, getting the scaffol[lastname]g up in a week also seems rather ambitious unless you have worked with these technologies before; then again if it is only one page, maybe not :) Final comment, I would move the Technological Approach to after Features sections. You rattled off all these technologies, but I was not 100% sure how everything fit in at this point, what you were exactly doing."	9/28/2015 21:12	498		
Student88	Student45	1	"This idea rocks! The reasoning and the need for it make this a great project for this course. Some questions: * You mention a wiki. Is the whole site one big wiki? if so why not just leverage an existing solution? * What will be on each page? Do you have that guideline? * What governance will be setup for the site? who gets to be an admin? * Can I create an account and go to town editing it? * Can I edit any page? * Are [lastname]es moderated? * Who decides what goes up? * Are certain areas protected? (e.g. authorization) * Do I have to edit via the API or can I edit it like a normal wiki? One addition that might be nice to your paper are examples of things that are found on the Google+, Piazza forums, HipChat, etc. that you would want to collect."	9/28/2015 21:20	577	6	Great feedback!
Student88	Student55	1	"I just read another proposal like this, but it was around consolidating all the information that exists at the many other sources. I like your idea much better. Having something that actually does advising, rather than data collection and centralizing is much more useful and would get used more than something that must be searched through and heavily maintained. Technically, Django is a huge framework. If you think you need everything it has to offer go for it, but be warned just how big it is. If you are trying to produce only the 12 pages you might rethink this. I think you have the profiles part really planned out, but the other section especially the course side, seems less so. As that is the biggest piece I think if anything, this week you should add more here. Also here were some of the questions I asked the other group and I think many of them apply here: * What governance will be setup for the site? who gets to be an admin? * Can I create an account and go to town editing it? * Can I edit any page? * Are [lastname]es moderated? * Who decides what goes up? * Are certain areas protected? (e.g. authorization) * Do I have to edit via the API or can I edit it like a normal wiki? Look forward to provi[lastname]g feedback in a month or so :)"	9/28/2015 21:37	519		
Student88	Student100	1	"I like your emphasis on specialization to help narrow the scope and how it leads to a better overall process. Your introduction and explaining the problem was very well thought-out and clearly laid out the appropriate background. I personally like to create some test cases, sites before getting too far into the development, so that might be something you consider doing in the earlier sprints."	9/28/2015 21:46	1880		
Student51	Student12	1	"Your group seems to have a good grasp of the technical side of your project but what about the User Experience/Story? Think about questions such as who are the admins going be? What type of content is useful to students whats not? How do you encourage good content and discourage bad? How will on boar[lastname]g a new course happen, is that something that takes place before the class is offered or something that takes place after the first semester. If a prof/ the school asks for something to be removed whats the process for that? If a student posts copyrighted training material, how will you/admins police that? Have you consider Accessibility issues for students with disabilities that may be using screen readers or other tools? See: http://www.w3.org/WAI/ and http://www.gatech.edu/accessibility ."	9/28/2015 21:21	805		
Student51	Student99	1	Your results is going be highly dependent on your Test data set. Thus I would suggest expan[lastname]g your section on your test data so you can get some more mentor and peer feedback on that. For example are you going to ask the participants to submit specific essays so their all on the same topic or just random assignments of their choice? Does it effect things if the ghost writer is one of the other participants or should all ghost writers be non participants? Does the setting the essay was written in/for matter? Ie is the writing style for a test the same as the writing style for a college application? Does the use of spell check and grammar check or a 3rd party editor effect things? Is there a minimal length required for the sample to be usable? Why three samples?	9/28/2015 21:35	811	7	
Student51	Student66	1	"There are two areas I would suggest thinking about for your design. 1: what type of error message are you going to provide back to students? Will it just be standard java error messages or will you try to provide more robust error messages along side the standard that help guide the student through fixing their error? The second is since your going to be tracking student data, have you looked into rather or not your going have to meet any standards for data/privacy protection before teachers will be allowed to use your software in a classroom?"	9/28/2015 21:48	915		
Student51	Student64	0	"It's unclear from your proposal what you final goal is. I would assume its a paper but there isn't any mention of that and you only have 13 hours allocated to it . It would be useful to see what common thread you will be looking for between all your interviews and observation. I might suggest by thinking about what your abstract would look like if you were to start writing it. If there is applicable details in your past work , I would suggest going ahead and inclu[lastname]g that in the proposal it self at this point."	9/28/2015 22:04	1237	7	This is helpful feedback. It lets me know what I need to address to in my full proposal.
Student7	Student29	1	"You have laid out an ambitious project with a lot of goals: creating the curriculum, teaching the course, analysis, and reflection. You did a good job splitting the tasks amongst the team members. Your task list was very detailed. Good luck with your project."	9/28/2015 21:31	978		
Student7	Student73	1	"Your proposal was clear and did a good job of listing your goals and tasks. I think your project will be helpful for students to see how they are doing with their requirements for a specialization. Highlighting whether students have completed their foundational requirement would also be valuable. I think the advisors get a lot of emails with questions about the foundational course requirement, so your tool could save them a lot of time."	9/28/2015 21:47	1951	7	"Thank you so much, that is a great idea!"
Student7	Student81	1	It looks like you have a good plan for what you want to accomplish. Your project is the only one I have read about with a military application. You mentioned HoloLens supports mentorship. I would be interested in hearing more about a scenario where the HoloLens would be used for training.	9/30/2015 17:41	852	6	
Student7	Student60	1	"Your proposal is very thorough and detailed. Your project seems like it could have some applications in the OMSCS program. You described 3 different types of project groups. Will your group formation algorithm be different for each type? Your goals are ambitious: writing group formation algorithm, setting up a database, setting up hosting, and a creating a UI with both a teacher and student views.

Student28	Student85	1	"While I think technology could be helpful, I don't think the lack of it in classrooms is the contributing factor to Am[firstname]a's rather sluggish system. If anything, I think there are too much being thrown at teachers without allowing them to properly define what they truly need. I think you do have a good idea here with a great mission. I would recommend running it by some of the teachers in the class to see what they think about it. Good luck with your project!"	9/28/2015 22:13	930		
Student28	Student98	0	"Please take this as an attempt to help with your Final Draft. You have a great mission to help the underprivileged and I would love to see it. However, it isn't completely clear how that could be achieved from this proposal yet. Is the end product a tool or a research paper? The first part of the proposal is only reciting the class deliverables without specific project details. The weekly schedule gives an idea on what you plan to do overall at a high-level, but without specific tasks and it's inclu[lastname]g both research or tool. And for surveys, is completing the CITI training required before you could start the survey process, so should that be included as a milestone with dependency? There are a lot of private data that would be used. How do you plan to handle protecting their privacy? This is a noble cause, but would required more depth to convey what would be accomplished. My recommendation is to look over some project proposals available online or within this class before the Final Draft is due. Good luck with the project!"	9/28/2015 22:29	1741	6	Seems like I left out a lot in the project proposal- first draft.

I would like to see you compare your tool to a publishers ""grade level"" recommended rea[lastname]g list. I think your tool offers a lot more than a recommended rea[lastname]g list since it should be able to focus on specific topics and use open source material on a much greater scale than a curated publishers or school rea[lastname]g list. You paper really makes me wish I had taken ML (machine learning) so I could have a better grasp of how you plan to accomplish some of these tasks. Have you given any thought to using a web API?

Student22	Student55	2	"Hello! You have a good idea here in my opinion and a needed tool. It is been a learning experience to be your own advisor and I think I would have made mistakes in what to take if I didn't have a circle of coworkers also in the program where we can discuss what we learned and know about classes now, upcoming and what to enroll in. It was confusing to not have to meet a pre-req for any class - your note about what requires Java or Python was very good - some courses assume you know little about Python and others imply you know it very well - students however don't know this until it is too late, so they might take the wrong class first! Arrgh! I do think that having one person to advise 2000 to 3000 students should be corrected and helped with such an automated advisor as you suggest. Two risks I see with your proposal are: 1. Creating a web program with a brand new tool you are not worked with before (Django). 2. Make your program flexible a bit so that if a program [lastname]es its requirements or allows more options for core - that you can handle those types of [lastname]es. I think your program as scoped is doable - this is something I am not so sure about with some other proposals I am rea[lastname]g this week. Good luck!"	9/28/2015 22:17	1285

When I read your project kept thinking of the ""Baby Einstein"" videos that teach kids shapes and words (you may want to look them up) for ideas. I think you are on track and have an idea of a fallback plan back to a web based program if time becomes a crunch - I see your time estimates as being a little low for most folks, but perhaps you are correct - hard to tell in a remote classroom environment!

Student22	Student88	1	"Hi [firstname], Nice proposal. You make a good point that often people move the same material straight to the web with no thought about how it would be interpreted differently. I like your first diagram that shows Q2 going to multiple Q3's ( you might consider the model that Sun Microsystems (now Oracle )) use in the Java Programmer tests - a progressively harder or simpler test based on how well the student is doing so far in the exam. I think your idea does have some considerable risks (as you list at the bottom of the document) so I suggest be prepared with some type of fallback plan just in case! I like the idea of better feedback as to what a student is facing - your note about Udacity does not show for example that this is a 5 minute section and the next is 38 seconds is very insightful - I don't like not having it myself. I am sure you will do well!"	9/28/2015 22:46	598

Your overview and goals statements are good, however I would suggest you break the thoughts up into more paragraphs instead of large chunks of text for easier readability. Your idea noting the viscous circle going around and around looking for information again and again from various sources can be confusion - especially to a new person to the program, I know it was for me when I stared in summer of 2014. I see there are some risks in your plan on the platform side especially - so you might want to have a fallback plan just in case. I see you already have a proposed API so you are well on your way!

Your proposal is carefully thought out, and you have thought of excellent contingencies in case some or all of your current plans fall through. For peer feedbacks, I try to make every attempt to offer anything I can to provide any assistance. I originally thought I couldn't offer you anything, but alas, I think I can. I have an idea, and I'm not sure if this is permissible, but I'd figured I'd share the thought. Using the third-party obfuscators, have them send out a blind email, that is you will never know who are recipients of the emails, only the number of emails sent. In the email, you would indicate they have been selected in a blind research study, a summary of the project's abstract might be useful. The email would further ask if they would voluntarily and anonymously fill out a survey to contribute towards the research. I am eagerly waiting to read about your fin[lastname]gs.

Just one minor correction, it's a Pro Trinket, as opposed to a Trinket Pro. I know a bit anal, but I'd figured you'd like to update your proposal and documents accor[lastname]gly. Your project is a very ambitious project, of which, you obviously have the experience to succeed. After rea[lastname]g this, and having the first-hand experience myself, I'd like to offer one suggestion. How about to versions of the kit a Teacher's version and the Student's version. Working with the Pro Trinket will require some delicate handling and good dexterity, but since it is similar to the Arduino Uno, maybe the Teacher's version should have several Unos for ini[firstname]l prototyping and programming. Once the prototyping and programming are completed, the students can [lastname]sfer their code to the Pro Trinket. To further build out the Teacher's kit, there should be additional supplies, or you can list them under ""Other classroom supplies"". Based on Adafruit's Pro Trinket description, you'll want also to include FTDI cable to debug using the FTDI serial connection; the USB connection is only for uploa[lastname]g code. Another item that may be worth trying out and/or incorporating is the LiIon/LiPoly Backpack Add-On ($4.95) which provides a rechargeable battery to the project.

I've seen a lot of positive shifts to making this less expensive with pi-botics kits, sphero, etc. but those are still in the $100+ range. One of the benefits of using a pi-bot, though, is that it is easier to teach younger children (with scratch) and most middle-schoolers seem to pick up on python, etc. easier than Arduino/C. However, take this with a grain of salt - for 7th graders, what you are doing is highly, highly value added. Can't wait to see the project! Student76reene Student76"	9/28/2015 22:53	971

Student76	Student2	1	"Hi, very interesting take! I have the following comments and questions about this subject. 1) I would be interested if any of the research actually showed that Student's really learn from that 30 seconds review of material (neither reference 3 nor 4 showed that this is value added time, rather that this is time spent - 4). 2) Thus, are we sure that there is a valid reason to make the course provider provide more content? 3) If so, how will this interface with the other content providers (i.e. Udacity, TSquare, Piazza)? 4) Say the top 3 points are sated, could the content provider be students? I.e. Students submit multiple choice questions which gets approved by instructors? This seems to be a winning strategy to help ba[firstname] contribution grades above just posting on Piazza/Peer Review - also, the question can be sourced to the student who creates it (kinda like Trivia Crack). Also, this is just personal taste, I would reorder the paper in the following order: sections 3-6, 1-2. The task list and calander before the explanation made those sections feel out of sequence. However, your mentor should understand the subject so it only impacts silly reviewers such as myself! This project looks really fun - and I love node.js! Best of luck.

Student55	Student10	2	"I can't believe I was assigned your proposal to peer review - what are the odds?! I think this may be the most promising project being done in our class this term. Rea[lastname]g the schedule, I'm struggling with which stage some of the core UI falls into. (For instance, by October 11th ""the basic flow will be implemented"" - is this just selecting and displaying the source text, or...?) I think it would be beneficial to give just one more level of detail on these early deliverables. Alternatively, a wireframe of the UI you're envisioning for the first and second stages would help convey these distinctions. (That sounds harder than it is - if you decide you like the wireframe idea, you can put together something really nice in Balsamiq with a minimum of effort.) The set of features you've devised is really spot-on, and the breadth of supporting tools you've identified is impressive. (For example, I had no idea that ResponsiveVoice offered a Chinese voice set!) On a personal note, out of all the projects in our class, this is the only one besides my own that really has a special place in my heart. I love Asian languages and I'm a strong believer in the power of learning through extensive rea[lastname]g (it's steadily gaining popularity in Japan, where it's dubbed ??). After rea[lastname]g your proposal, I'm even more excited because I can see how just the simplest things you suggest (clarifying word boundaries, for instance) will empower beginning readers. So if there's anything I can do to help, for instance setting up web hosting or tracking down beta testers or helping you debug a persnickety NLTK plugin as you approach the deadline, please ping me any time (Student55)."	9/28/2015 23:23	15

After rea[lastname]g it I come away convinced that your project will offer value beyond that provided by current tools, and that you've really thought out a coherent design. The early part of the proposal mentions the inability to integrate with unit testing frameworks as a particular challenge for $expect, and you mention WebDriver so I assume you are doing some functionality testing. However, the ""Application Features"" section only seems to describe tests for static elements (DOM checking, W3C validation, etc.). Is the project primarily aimed at HTML/CSS (i.e., static) web development in this first phase? And in particular, do tests need to be single-page tests or can user flows (e.g., a user can log into your web application) be tested as well? A clarification on this point would be helpful (though it's really a minor quibble). Overall - neat project, and it'll be fun to see how it turns out. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/4/2015 1:03	873		
Student55	Student68	1	"This idea (coor[lastname]ating teaching in several different classroom settings to compare results) is really neat!

E.g., Person: [firstname] [firstname]raj Location: New [lastname], New [lastname] Setting: Middle-school (extracurricular) Person: Student68 ... and so on. While I think the top-level goals are clear (""We will attempt to answer..."") and the low-level tasks are clear (""To gather data, we will...""), I found it challenging to understand the connection between these two - how you're getting from point A (e.g., conducting surveys) to point B (e.g., can humor and games be used to enhance learning?). I feel the proposal would benefit from some bridging explanation - for example, how specifically will you design your courses or your surveys to address those questions? It might not be feasible to explore all of these questions in the proposal, but just calling out one as an example could be quite helpful to the user."	10/4/2015 1:17	491		
Student55	Student94	0	"Applying EdTech in a Montessori environment is a very interesting angle. Rea[lastname]g your summary, I can see ways in which technology is a natural fit for Montessori, and other ways in which it tends to work at cross-purposes because of Montessori's emphasis on hands-on learning and physical manipulation of objects in the environment. I struggled to follow the flow of this proposal, and to understand why some sections are included. The opening section set up the research area as focused on Montessori education, and then the proposal suddenly shifted to discussing ConnectED - an ini[firstname]tive aimed at public schools. Then it shifts to discussing a couple of possibilities for exploring the central research question, which I *think* is whether and when simulated materials can replace traditional physical materials in the Montessori environment. I think that you selected the first possibility (build a set of simulated materials and observe children using it), because that's the one to which all of the tasks in the task list seem to pertain. But I'm not 100% clear on it. Some of the tasks (e.g., ""design survey or questionnaire for research"") don't seem to tie to the simulated environment. Unfortunately this is probably coming in too late to help you with your final proposal, but one technique which I saw used to great effect on others was the abstract: beginning the proposal with a one- or two-paragraph summary gave the ""big picture"" of the research goal / what the team decided to pursue, and then the proposal itself could fill in details about motivation, feasibility, etc. I think that ad[lastname]g an abstract where you indicate what general path you're following (e.g., ""In this project we will compare the efficacy of simulated materials to traditional physical materials in the Montessori environment. We intend to develop an application for X device and perform trials with 3 preschool-aged children to..."" etc.) would help quite a bit.

Student100	Student65	2	"Would like to have seen a little more background on this from the literature. I'm sure this mostly embedded in earlier assignments, but I'd like to have seen a bit more here.

Might consider ad[lastname]g in a bit more AI to determine which questions to focus on (i.e, last time [firstname]y mastered the easy array questions, so this time we'll give mostly medium array questions). LOTS of detail in both the functional specification and in the project plan. My feedback here would be that you almost have TOO much detail at this point (though most of the detail is likely in line with reality...i.e, most of the detail is front-loaded. Things are going to [lastname]e and schedules are going to be missed. This is pretty aggressive. Hope you can hit beta in a month, but it sounds tough. I think I'd personally look at beta post class and focus class time on getting as much of your stretch done as possible. Anyway, I [firstname]ed this as excee[lastname]g expectations because it does.

Student100	Student94	0	"I know this is a draft, but before getting to the actual project, I must note that the proposal reads as though you've tried to stitch together multiple different parts of multiple proposals each at different phases of development. You start with a discussion of Montessori and it's purported benefits (and a question about how or why one might want to improve upon it, which I thought to be an odd question). Then, after you begin your problem discussion, you jump into a discussion about how the ConnectEd program is helping to integrate technology into a few low income (but NOT Montessori) classrooms mixed in with some challenges inherent in technology adoption. You then look at technology tools in use (by Montessori programs presumably) before stating that they mostly have physical tools (again odd and a bit contradictory). It's really difficult to discern a meaningful flow from this. It wasn't until page 11 that I had any idea where you were going with this. And quite honestly, where you ended up has almost nothing to do with ConnectEd or Montessori. But, once I got to the actual proposal, I do see where you want to go with this and it is an interesting question. I personally can't imagine that the hypothesis will be supported (i.e., I think the physical shapes almost have to be more effective), but maybe there will be benefits to the drag and drop game-like environment that you might be able to tease out in a study like this. But I will also note that your study does nothing at all to test this hypothesis. You are creating a game that might be used to test the hypothesis (and unless I'm missing something, there are many of these types of games already in the various mobile stores). There's a lot of time left in your schedule in November. I don't know that there's enough time there to conduct and analyze the results from a full experiment, but it seems a waste to use that a month almost solely to observe two children playing the game and documenting issues. Short of doing the full experiment, is there something that you can add to the application to make it somehow better or more appropriate for your research than one of the alternative shape matching games already on the [firstname]et? You want to be able to determine if ""children grasped the concept of shapes"" better using your tool. Can you define how to measure that? If so, is there some way to add specialized data collection to your app that might help you in determining this? Looking at the tasks that you have proposed, it looks like you are also planning on conducting the survey research, as well (not ""alternatively""). This is a good thing. Though I would suggest two things. First, the questions you've provided are all very open ended. And quite good, though MUCH much broader in scope than your stated research question (and honestly, you really couldn't answer the research question from these survey questions). You won't get quantitative data from this. That's fine, too. It can be a qualitative analysis. But with so many questions, you also will likely not get very complete responses from your surveys if they are just sent out with a letter. I'd suggest trying to schedule a meeting with each of your poten[firstname]l subjects and deliver the questions interactively. Take a voice recorder so you don't have to spend all your time writing ([lastname]scribe later) and try to ask your questions informally. You're likely to get much richer feedback, that way. And the survey won't appear so overwhelming to your subjects. I would also suggest moving this up to the very beginning if possible. Answers that you receive should help you create a better game."	9/29/2015 22:30	14		
Student100	Student68	1	"The project has laudable goals. Certainly improving CS education is critical. Especially for younger students so that we can fill our society's need for more and better programmers. That said, truly answering even one of your 10 questions would be a challenge. (Most) any one by itself might be the topic of a dissertation. Some [firstname]ly can't be answered (e.g., an ""optimum lesson plan"" is like an ""optimum hamburger recipe""--your never at a point where improvement stops and even something that seems ""perfect"" to one person will be far from it for others). I strongly suggest that you significantly narrow your scope of inquiry. To answer any question in an experimental setting like this, you need to have a control group and a treatment group. In other words, you need to try something with one group and try something different with another group. There are lots of variations on experimental design but that's the fundamental tenet. Even if you're doing qualitative data analysis. Are you doing this? It isn't clear. Is there an implied control (i.e., have the students already taken a class taught the other way or have the teachers already taught and collected data using some method that you intend to [lastname]e)? Are you actually repeating steps 3-5, or is an updated lesson plan from one pass all that you're getting? I'm not saying that you won't be able to intuit useful data from this. For personal edification, this will be a fun exercise no matter what. And maybe I'm not fully understan[lastname]g the process you intend to follow. But if you are inten[lastname]g to conduct academic/scientific inquiry here, you are probably going to need to pick a much narrower research question(s) and structure a more controlled experiment. With specific things that you [lastname]e (independent variables) and measure specific outcomes (dependent variables). I'm guessing in the end what you'll have is a (very interesting) multi-site case study with some ""professional observations"" on the perceived efficacy of some [lastname]es. That's fine. In fact I really look forward to rea[lastname]g/watching it. But I'd probably dial back your expectations in terms of fin[lastname]g answers. You do mention that you don't intend to publish your research. That's a shame. And I suppose that does get you out of the need to do the human subjects training or get IRB approval. But you'd be surprised the types of studies that do require approval. If you are truly just passively observing a minor [lastname]e to a curriculum you already teach, then you'd be fine. And I think there are some loopholes built in for educators doing educational research with their own students. But if you are recruiting and actively studying a population (especially children), then IRBs will definitely want to be involved in seeing your recruitment materials, your consent forms, your surveys, etc."	9/29/2015 23:00	3379		
Student100	Student10	2	"So this is a REALLY awesome idea. I agree. I haven't seen anything quite like this before for any language. I think you really want to jump on that plugin, though. The extra step of copying and pasting, switching tabs, rea[lastname]g the story and [lastname]ing back would seem to take away from ""staying immersed."" And since all three major browsers will soon support Chrome-style plugins, it'll be pretty easy to maintain across browsers. I don't think you need to make the plugin too crazy, either. Maybe just have the user select the text and middle click (or whatever) to pop-up an overlay (or a frame to the left/right) with your [firstname]ups. Maybe later you could add fancier features like doing the [firstname]up inline on the page (i.e., without requiring a separate frame or pup-up overlay). But that could certainly wait as it is likely to be quite finicky. Regar[lastname]g [lastname]slation, yeah, you want to stay immersive. But maybe you could allow a user to hover over a word to see the [lastname]slation? Enough of a hassle that they won't do it by default, but there in case they need a quick peek/hint? Rather than gra[lastname]g a student's pronunciation, could you use speech recognition to determine whether the computer recognizes what they are saying? Not quite as good, but it might give them some sense of whether they are pronouncing things correctly. Certainly SEEMS much easier than creating some kind of ""score"" for correctness. And if you have the computer say ""I don't think that was quite right. I heard you say 'the cheese feels like marshmallow swords'"" (or whatever), the results could be quite humorous. :) Anyway, great proposal. Very complete and very well thought out. I don't have too much to add other than good luck! And I can't wait to play with it. :)"	9/30/2015 20:04	2150

I think a web-based tool provides more options to bridge any OS gaps but it would certainly be doable to build an iOS solution off the Android model at some point. I agree that an app that can be used without an internet connection is optimal so a native application is the preferred solution, especially given the target of low socioeconomic status homes. You may want to check with the Lifeline rules (https://www.fcc.gov/lifeline) if you plan to target personal devices. I don't know what limitations there may be besides the one discount per household."	9/29/2015 0:35	14	6	
Student71	Student78	1	"This is a very interesting project. It also is ambitious. Quite a bit of work for one so I agree with the approach to use a known technology (Windows forms). Not sure whether you covered this, but algebraic questions can be spawned infinitely with random constant generation, etc... I assume that's the idea vs. a database of exercises. If that is not the plan, it may be worth a little bit of project time to try to experiment with such an engine."	9/29/2015 22:17	2153		
Student71	Student5	1	"Very well done. This would be a really helpful application for new students (existing as well actually). One thing, you may want to consider a name [lastname]e. It's not exactly the same as i-Ready but i-Ready is a registered trade[firstname]. Here is the link http://www.curriculumassociates.com/products/iready/diagnostic-instruction.aspx.

Student13	Student82	1	"Hi [firstname]. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your project proposal. I agree the AES's are a useful idea, and see the inclusion of these into say the Georgia Tech OMS CS program and others are being fruitful. In your project, you describe looking to build a skip-thought vector space model. I like the premise, and note your comment that: ""A skip-thought vector allows for two sentences to be compared for semantic relatedness and are scored from one to five with one not being related and five being highly related. I am curious in general, is this a key aspect that will help improve the performance of your approach relating to a modern AES? For example, you note that: 'Skip-thought vectors to address a limitation of the vector space model."" How do these models address the limitation of the vector space model and how will you test things to confirm. You may get to it later down in the paper, but I am just curious and would love to have that front loaded. Furthermore, you note that: ""The main limitation of the vector space model is that it is uses lower-level traits to score papers."" Can you elaborate on why this is a limitation? Are there other ways aroudn the limitation? And, do you have rigorous support for this from a journal article persepctive. I see a few papers cited, but didn't see as much as I might have expected. In terms of your timeline, the timeline makes good sense to me. As I read through things, I wonder. Will tasks 7 and 8 - the creating of the prototype - be doable in 2 weeks? You didn't note - at least yet in the paper how you would actually create things? Will this be an application? What language will you use? Do you have any idea on how you might even structure things? What is a poten[firstname]l architecture that might work? Classes you might use? Again, am just curious from a design perspective whether you have enough time to both design and build in here & am wanting to make sure that you are all set up. I like the fact that you talked about the analysis that will be performed. My question is how. Does the score have to match exactly for you to determine that a program was successful? What about a fuzzy match? What about if a program or your algorithm matches on 96% of the terms or on 9 / 10 scores? Are you going to produce or use confidence bands and, if you do, how will you use them? All in all, I liked what you described from a high level. That said, at root I wanted some more depth. How will you get from the idea to the actual application? What tools, technology, and applications will you use? Will you need any specialized architecture or platform to do all the processing? How will you measure success in a very concrete way? And what error will you accept? If you can tackle that in your next draft I think that it would really add to your final project. That & also ad[lastname]g to your references list would help you later when you need to actually create a full journal article or final paper to summarize what you created! Good luck and if you need any support or have questions please reach out! (Nate [lastname]; nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/29/2015 0:59	2218	7	"Thanks Nate! The prototype should be feasible in one to two weeks since I am using mock data. As you suspected, I will be using thresholds to determine the rubric score based on the output of the semantic relatedness technology I end up using. I don't plan on using specialized hardware to do the processing. I will run it using my desktop computer which is why I will be scaling up from mock data, to three papers, to thirty papers, to all papers. By the time I'm processing all of the papers the AES will be basically done and it's just a matter of analyzing the data."
Student13	Student46	1	"Hi [firstname]. I really appreciated everything that you wrote and want to thank you for taking the time to share things. I loved your interest in educational gaming. For the size of this project I love that you reduced the scope down to one that teaches binary and number systems. You have an ambitious project - creating a game in a couple of months - so of course one needs to watch the scope. That said, it sounds exciting. In terms of the game, I had a number of general questions. You mention that the game will start off as a smple fun puzzle. I assume that you mean with stage 0. I had a curious question. Do you have any literature to cite that supports the notion that this type of flow engourages user engagement over the long term? I can just see an academic or industry reviewing offering that objection and would encourage you to buffer against it. For example, what is an ""intimidating"" or ""boring"" problem (asking as you said rather than here)? Does this depend on the learner? The chalk board can be intimidating for many - but it is mainly because of the audience I would argue. Has there been any research done to support things here? In terms of your stages, I love how you laid the stage pieces out. You talk about having the balls of various sizes fall from the sky. Is there something special about this that makes this type of a start an easy game for learners? Are there parallels to other games out there. It seems simple, but just wanted to challenge it. Also, I see that the stages [lastname]e by the colors becoming numbers. Is there any evidence to show that learners are able to easily make this link or that the bucket displays of ones, tens, hundreds will work. Again, not wanting at all to disuade the approach. Just food for thought! Also, if you are creating a NEW approach, I want you to be sure to call it out and say hey, this approach is novel! Of course you note that the stages will [lastname]e. I just wanted you to take advantage of this special opportunity to investigate the stages. You also talk about animations, and I wanted to again here ask for validation. Is there any evidence that animations may work to [lastname]force this type of learning? All in all, I think you are well on your way! I like the overall tasks. I do have a question. I don't see a ton in here about the actual build and design. What tools or technology will you use? Where will the game be hosted? What will it be built by? And, in your approach, I didn't see a lot of time built in for testing. You proposing beginning work on the mini game on the 8th and finishing on the 15th ... Is that enough time? Of course you have time to polish. That said, I want to make sure that you have enough time to polish things off well! I see that you mentioned that you will build the game in Java! Is there anything else that you will need tool wise? Have a great night and good luck! Looks like an exciting project. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you want more feedback or insight!

Student13	Student35	2	"Hi [firstname]! I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your project proposal. YOu have put a lot of thought into things and it reflects. The problem that you mention you will be focusing on is contribution analysis. It is an interesting area indeed. I have to firstly aplaud you on your use of references in the review, as you haev the best referenced paper I have seen. Your table that summarizes the benefits of automating contribution analysis is clean ad really makes sense. Now, I do have a problem. Are these benefits ones that you propose? Or, as these from a source? I didn't see a source listed here. I am also curious on the description or example. For example, do you have evidence that ""random gra[lastname]g can be detrimental to student morale?"" I enjoyed your review of related work. It was fitting and again different from other projects that I have seen. You note that you found no prior ""art"" directly aimed at solving the problem. I was confused as what you meant by art, and wonder if this was a typo? I liked your review in ranking developers and also your review of general assessment techniques. I guess my question here is what is the main point you want to make in this section? It was just a thought that came into my mind at the end and I wanted to share it! In your sections 2.2, you discuss the ""how does it fall short"" piece. I would have actually loved to see this expanded and 2.1 shortened. For example, you mention that the ""tools discussed here do not address the problem of assessing student co[lastname]g contributions."" Can you give specific examples? I mean, top coder does reward you based on the ""number"" of contributions ... is that an assessment? The other point here that you make is that: ""It is also unclear from the description of these artifacts if they are extensible."" This is the first time I saw this, and I immediately wondered - why does this matter? Does extensibility somehow relate to effective contribution analysis? Again, something that came to mind that I was really unsure of. You note here that: ""The novelty of the system lies in pulling together various sources of data and connecting them with pedagogical goals."" What goals are you trying to connect and why? Perhaps really pointing out in a tangible way why your approach is novel would help. I think it would give you great strength in the actual paper piece. In section 3 you talk about your solution. I like that you are going to build an application, and immediately wonder as I read about scope. You talk for example about supplementing the system with peer feedback tools. Is this feasible within the time that you plan to build? You then talk about design issues. I agree that metrics is a funny or tough issue. You mention that: ""Software engineering metrics should be selected ..."" Which metrics and why? I was a little confused about your section called ""What is code?"" ... as I wasn't sure what you wanted to make point wise. Finally, your design approach makes sense. You are going to do an app. That said, the contribution metrics, data sources, and connectors require a lot of work. Do you have enough time to get there? AS you get into step 4, I again start to wonder about scope. You mention that Java will be used to design the application. You also describe the stack. How familiar are you with the stack? This relates to my final questions at the end. YOu talk about the task list and milestones. You have 4 weeks noted here to implement the functional requirements and build the application. That said, this time all overlaps other tasks. What I would love to see is this broken down into a more manageable task list or timing list. Also, my gut feeling - and I could be wrong - is to shorten your scope. I have big ambitions also, but the hardest thing in research is to control that scope. My gut feeling warning alarms are going off right now looking at this going - okay - this is a big endeavor. You may be able to get there. That said, I don't see time in here for testing for example. Where will that happen? Also, what about deployment? Will you make the app deployable? You also have a couple of weeks for creating the user manual. Is that enough time? That also overlaps with simulation, deployment, and bug fixing. Are you working full time on the project to accomodate that load? Again, just general comments to help. I love what you are doing and am here to help and offer advice if you need it! Wonderful work and a great document. Reach out if you have more questions! (Nate [lastname]; nj[lastname]@sfu.ca) Excited to see what you produce next!"	9/29/2015 2:03	2691		
Student13	Student72	1	"Hi Student94 and [firstname]. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g the first draft of your proposal and look forward to seeing how your project develops. If you need more insight from me please don't hesitate to reach out (Nate [lastname]; nj[lastname]@sfu.ca). I like that you focus on the montessori approach. It is an interesting approach and I am interested to see how it works for you! I like that your research will focus on the use of technology to implement Montessor teaching teachniques - with the goal of increasing general access to the Montessori method. It sounds like a sensical goal overall, and I am interested in seeing how you will weave a technology solution around it. Your page 2 is interesting, as it frames up the montessori vs traditional debate in a way that is useful for a reader with no background. I do have a question. Is there any evidence that this method can really work better than other methods? I mean, I know of it. That said, I can see someone challenging whether the method is rigorously better. For example, you note that, in the Montessor, class size is not rigidly set. The class size that you mentioned seems very high to me, and I am broadly curious here. As you start to talk about things, inclu[lastname]g outcomes and studies, I am curious. You talk about the Milwaukee high school graduates who significantly outperformed their peers. Can you provide context? What were the measures they used to measure? I am asking since I wonder whether you could steal some of the methods and use them in your own work. Also, are ther confidence bands in place that might impact your work? Also, you then talk about the positive impact on materials. The pretest/posttest results have a total of 4 students in the sample size. Is this big enough to actually draw a conclusion? Asking since you will likely face similar choices and I am curious overall. How big si the sample size that you will eventually need or want to include? As a first thought, I might offer that you poten[firstname]lly be careful in some sections of generalizzations. For example, you noted in this section that: ""From the research above, the montessori approach excels by far in the total development of the child."" You only unfortunately included a few cited documents, and I want to make sure that you don't over generalize. Also, if I can, I was a little confused on the point you wanted to make on page 5 when you started talking about Tim Cook, Apple, the ""inclusions of diversity"". I guess I want to know how it relates to your project specifically, or, whether this is just general information to know. The same is true for pages 6 - 10. I loved the table with contents. That said, I wonder whether you could condense it? I also wasnt sure about the goal and would encourage you to explore it. On page 10 you then talk about technologies used. You note that you will include the tools due to the support they will offer for supporting and improving Montessor programs. How does MathBlaster do this (Noting that is has no advantage listed). What might have helped me here is more effectively articulating how the advantages or disadvantages relate to Montessori learning. For example, you talk about Researchgj introducing ""Security concerns when children have access to the internet or their computers."" How is this a Montessori problem .... or is it? I just wasn't sure what to take from the table & thus ask the questions as they have come to me. Finally, you close this section by asking the following: ""The problem is that most of the montessori tools developed are physical tools. Is it possible to [lastname]slate these physical tools to technological tools?"" I am interested in your arguments here but felt that I didn't get enough of them yet. What would prevent the physical tools from [lastname]slating into technological tools? As I continue rea[lastname]g I have more of the same questions & encourage you to back up your arguments and take time to support them. For example, you note that: ""The hypothesis that would be valid here is that after using the technological tool on shapes children grasped the concept on shapes better or equal to using physical shapes."" How is this hypothesis valid and based on what evidence? How wil you test this? In the end of your paper you start to get towards the method pieces. You talk about the hypothesis above, and then propose that: ""To address this hypothesis students could be grouped into three categories, those using only physical tools(PT), those using only technological tools(TT) and those having access to both tools (MT). After observing each group over the same period of time, we could conclude on the efficacy of technological tools in the montessori approach. A pre test and a post test can be done on each group to be able to test the assertion. "" This is where I felt confused & would love you to be a tad stronger. What are you going to do and why? You are talking about an experimental design being conducted? Will this be done in your research? If this is longitu[lastname]al, then is there enough time to actually do this? Also, what is the right sample size. You choose 6 teachers. Is this just to try and get data and see what you get, or something else? Next you move to mock-ups. I would love for you to expand on the mock-ups. How will these be seen? What are you testing on the mock-ups shown? My next question to you is confidence. How confident are you that you can execute the research design? You are submitting this but have already lots of items that were due for September 27, 2015. Are these all done & when were theye completed. Also, you talk about things like the ""build, distribute, track, address issues"" & allocate 10 hours for this. Is that enough time & is this reasonable? What about testing? Deployment? Where and how will you serve up your game? I would encourage you to be careful on scope, as you want to finish by December. That said, just something to consider. All in all a good job and a good start. I look forward to seeing what you are both able to produce!"	9/29/2015 2:48	4109	1	Excellent feedback from Nate. I really appreciate the time he took to analyze the paper's strengths and weaknesses. I'm sure our final proposal will be much better thanks to his insightful feedback.
Student60	Student20	1	"In my previous work place, we had a system to promote learning and innovation among team. I felt that system didnt do a good job.

Student33	Student90	2	This is truly amazing. This is the first that I have ever heard of developmental dyscalculia and I think that it is a very admirable undertaking. Seems like it will take well over 100 hours but we can see how it goes.	9/29/2015 12:56	119	6	
Student101	Student47	2	"Great job on your proposal, your topic for your project is quite interesting. I feel your paper was well written and your detail throughout it was more than sufficient. I am anxious to see how you will convince your audience of how technology based is greater than non-technology based systems. The only possible additive missing that stuck out to me was references, but I feel even without them your paper was more than suffice. Good luck!!!"	9/29/2015 12:42	55		
Student101	Student33	1	"I love your idea for your project, it is very admirable and I wish you two the best of luck! I also like the interviews you are proposing to conduct, nothing like getting input from real live sources. The flow of your paper was going smooth until �Appendix� came up. I think there should be a conclusion, or an explanation of what the reader should be taking away from rea[lastname]g your appendix. The paper goes from the tasks to appendix. If you fix that I feel your proposal would be much better."	9/29/2015 12:43	273	7	
Student101	Student91	0	"Your project seems to be a great idea and you have been very detailed in your approach. I did find that your writing style needs some improvement. At times I found your writing hard to follow, which made it difficult to understand what exactly you were trying to get across to the reader. Grammar, use of punctuation, and sentence structure are some of the areas that need attention. Below are examples taken from your paper. From page four, second paragraph: With this definition of the �Concepts�, they will be related between them in a hierarchical way, when applicable, and, the �Concept elements� will be related also to with other �Concepts�. From page four, fourth paragraph: As soon as the assistant detect that the student is coming back to a modeled �Concept element� included in a �Concept�, or when the student is asking to review a modeled �Concept�, the assistant should present a concept or mind map covering the constructed model to the student. From page four, sixth paragraph: When watching, or rea[lastname]g, or working on a �Concept element� (this is, the student access maybe a wiki link or a video lecture segment, for example), the assistant will capture in a semi-automatic way all its details, student highlighted sections, and Student own Text Notes, for example. From page 5, last paragraph: An example of generalization here would be when a �Concept� with �Keyword� equal to �Texas History�, and a �Concept� with �Keyword� equal to �New [lastname] History�, have been both set also a �Keyword� equal to �US History�. The result here would be a bigger �Concept� with a �Keyword� equal to �US History� and two related hierarchically inclusive �Concepts� with �Keywords� equal to �Texas History� and �New [lastname] History�, respectively. From page six, first paragraph: An example of specialization here would be when a �Concept� with �Keywords� equal to �Texas History�, �New [lastname] History�, and �US History�, starts to have important review accesses groupings chunks through the two different �Keywords�, �Texas History� and �New [lastname] History�. In this case the result will be two hierarchically inclusive �Concepts� with �Keywords�, �Texas History� and �New [lastname] History�, respectively, and the �Concept� with �keyword� equal to �US History� (The rest of the �Keywords�) as composed of the first two."	9/29/2015 12:48	122	7	I like the indications with the sentences with readability problems. At least I can improve my writing style focusing on those sentences.
Student101	Student90	2	"Very well written! It was never clear on whether or not our papers should be double spaced; but like you I also double space my papers. IMO, I feel it is much easier to read someone�s paper if it is double spaced. The only issue (if it is even one) I saw, was some of your titles were centered and some were not, if this is done on purpose then disregard. Other than that, your proposal was well done. Good luck with your work! I never knew what Dyscalculia was or is until after I started to read your paper. It is a very interesting topic. What you have proposed to do if successful, will be a quite an honorable deed. Good luck with your work!"	9/29/2015 12:50	77	6

Student5	Student26	2	"Hi [firstname] and [firstname], I've read about your idea in Piazza and Google Spreadsheet and I am very impressed with your proposal. You clearly identified the problem, did research on existing solutions, and have a well defined project scope. Automated gra[lastname]g can help both students and teachers as seen in Udacity platform in our OMSCS program. Wish you success in creating such a neat application."	10/1/2015 14:03	259	4	
Student5	Student70	2	I never thought about the problem of children in low socioeconomic households had such a disadvantage. Great idea on an application to help those children get up to speed and immerse themselves in vocabulary learning. Good choice for android since that is most used tablet OS that doesn't cost a fortune. Wish you luck in your project!	10/1/2015 14:07	224	6	
Student9	Student46	1	"Hi [firstname], I'm glad you are pursuing educational games, and I agree with your philosophy on open-ness. The core design sounds workable as well - so good work there. I have a few critiques / issues which haven't been addressed in the document. Much of the game research I've done highlights the importance of the 'frame' or fiction when developing reputation based games. In the case of DragonBox - they went with a fantasy setting, and a specific art style. If the purpose of a game is higher level of motivation, what aspects to you imagine will increase student motivation? How can you improve those? Is gameplay enough? Just looking at the industry right now, mechanics drive very little motivation, and [firstname]eting and aesthetics drive a lot more. One of the core problems with educational software which doesn't consider a frame first, is that students still will not want to engage with it. While parents may 'force' kids to play it - it is then not really a game, and the benefits of using a game are lost. So I suppose my #1 question is - why will kids want to play this game? On the other hand, if solving those issues are outside the scope - this project sounds more like a digital tutor than a game - which isn't a bad thing. I think a lot of digital tutoring systems can learn a lot from games like dragon box, and your incremental approach to teaching sounds like a good strategy for a digital tutor."	9/29/2015 13:33	1126	7	
Student9	Student72	1	"The project is intriguing. As I understand it - the key question is can the Montessori approach work digitally? You identify the key reason for this project being that a Montessori education could be made more affordable with technology - however, as you later point out, schools are critically underfunded when it comes to technology. You follow that up by stating the problem is being tackled by the president and Tim Cook - however, that claim seems a bit unfounded when the amount donated by apple is 100 million. Is the problem really tackled, or is this a [firstname]eting gesture? The Newark school system budget is about 1 billion annually. A lot of presidents have claimed to have fixed the school system, so far, they've all come up I think this argument is a distraction from your more interesting focus, that is, can Montessori principles work digitally. I'd suggest narrowing the focus on what principles of a Montessori education can work digitally - that alone is interesting. Maybe it's more affordable, maybe not - however EITHER way - it's an interesting investigation. In terms of the tools and effects - you cite a number of advantages and disadvantages. Where do these come from? I've never heard of Math Blasters being negative because it advocates violence, for example. It portrays violence, but is that the same as advocating violence? There is some room for investigation here. On the other hand, Sim Ant - the only positive cited is that it teaches about ants. How does it teach about ants? Does it follow the Montessori approach? I guess I'd want to see a deeper investigation into the underlying principles of Montessori - such as ""Student choice of activity from within a prescribed range of options"" and evaluate existing solutions based on the matrix of principles - and then go from there."	9/30/2015 9:43	1731	6	
Student9	Student35	2	"First paper I've seen that exceeded my expectations. The idea is sound and your scope is sound. I particularly like that you make no specific claim for it's use. I think this is ready to go - but I'll add my own thoughts on group metrics, maybe it's worth something, maybe not. When I've worked professionally in groups (which is most of the time) - there are always strong and weak members of the team. The best colleagues I've had who were stronger acted as mentors. The worst ran to a corner and did everything themselves. Conversely the best weaker colleagues came with a humble attitude and a willingness to learn - the worst were stubborn. None of these traits had much to do with code. I'd rather have a humble junior engineer on my team than a stubborn pro. Stubborn pro might write a lot of code - it might even be good code - but it also might be designed incorrectly, or do something we didn't need. Also - eventually abusive members of the team get fired, because everyone else complains. In that sense, group projects do prepare engineers for the realities of the world. That said - it would be great if the data were there to assist in calling out the team members who aren't working as part of the team. I'm trying to figure out how I would evaluate everyone at a g[firstname]. Commit frequency and size of [lastname]es? Some kind of tagging system? Maybe number of lines of code removed? It's a difficult question. I'd consider plotting the data - I think looking at a project over time along a few of these axes will be revealing. In any case, nice work. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with."	9/30/2015 19:07	3357		
Student9	Student13	2	"This looks like a solid plan, well researched, and well within the scope of the semester. It's tough to give feedback on this, since it seems like a very solid plan - however, I'm interested in two aspects - First - it would be awesome if there were a way to connect the measured data to some kind of underlying predictive theory ahead of time ""e.g. we think work / school ba[firstname] is a lea[lastname]g cause of failure, and we can predict increased work pressure by XYZ"". This is probably unrealistic - but I think it might lead to interesting choices in variable selection. Second - I think the variables you've chosen are good - but I wonder what exactly you are looking for? Averages? Deltas? Sudden deltas? A particular shape over time? Combined with clustering, this is poten[firstname]lly a lot of analysis - which is why I was suggesting considering some possible failure causes. Although, as you suggest, the patterns may reveal themselves after you have the data - but sometimes a bit of hypothesizing ahead of time leads to interesting results when looking at unexpected data. Alternatively - would it be possible to interview a few students and incorporate their subjective answers - maybe after the fact, so as not to bias the design? Anyway, just a few thoughts on an excellent write up. Nice work - I hope you'll share the data - I look forward to rea[lastname]g it. I can tell you the times I feel like I struggle the most is when I take a few weeks off to deal with work. Maybe high degrees of engagement variance would predict longer term trouble for me :)"	9/30/2015 20:03	1253	7	This was very helpful and in line with what I am working on!
Student78	Student77	1	Excellent idea for a project. I too believe that making supplemental content readily available would be incredibly useful! I have shared articles on Piazza before and they did invoke conversation. I really liked the up voting and favoring part of your idea as well. I think these would be very useful.	9/29/2015 15:36	288		
Student78	Student70	1	Interesting idea for a project/product. I am not sure I agree that it would be widely used but if it were I think if would be of great benefit. Only advice on your paper is that I would have put the problem first so that I knew what I was looking at prior to task list and schedule.	9/29/2015 15:41	227	5	
Student78	Student26	2	Very well written paper and an excellent idea for a project. I would be very interested in seeing the final product. Good luck!	9/29/2015 15:44	229	4	
Student78	Student1	1	This is the first research/tool hybrid project I've heard of but sounds very interesting. I would like to read your final research paper.	9/29/2015 15:48	141	7	
Student93	Student28	1	"I like the conciseness of the proposal. It was easy to read and follow the tables -- it definitely gives an impression that this is not the first time for someone in the group writing this type of proposals. I have one doubt though: each time our company was trying to centralize the resources, the solution was becoming yet another resource. Do you anticipate this issue? Also, it looks like this solution is not one off and will require maintenance and support. What are your plans in continuing to provide the platform after the semester is over? Would this be a complete solution or a prototype? I am curious how did the team selects itself -- did you all kind work towards this solution? Or was it proposed by one of the team members?"	9/29/2015 18:13	746	7	
Student93	Student92	1	"I think the idea of chunking and spaced repetition will work great. I personally use this technique a lot, however NEVER to computer programming. It just didn't occur to me :) I am also not familiar with web development so I cannot provide feedback on the scope of the project. My background is on analytics and algorithms side and I strongly recommend inclu[lastname]g following sections in your project: -- how are you going to evaluate the success of the project. Just proposing something and explaining why it WOULD work is not going to be enough. -- describe the algorithm in more detail (currently it has only vague description about means, medians and decay theory). This could be a core for what makes your product stand out."	10/1/2015 8:40	1051		
Student93	Student3	1	"Hi [firstname]. I like what you are trying to address and it is a very important subject which you presented in good detail in this proposal. I do not have any experience in the K-12 Educational technology, so I am not aware of the issues around the deployment. Thus I would focus my recommendation on the proposal delivery style: -- it is a bit confrontational (""I aim to shed light on the obscure short-sightedness of K-12 Educational Technology "") rather than conversational. In my experience this puts off a lot of people even if they like the idea of the [lastname]e. -- it looks like the outcome of this project will be a blue print to support successful deployment of technologies. So I recommend allocating more areas in the proposal to this subject. You par[firstname]lly did that in the tasks sections (which is very clear btw!) however in my mind those are more like milestones. -- it would be nice if you add references as well. Beyond that there is nothing more that I can suggest. I hope you make the [lastname]e in the K-12 world :)"	10/1/2015 8:58	1186	6	"I agree, I am a bit jaded by the K-12 industry and will try to make it more conversational."
Student93	Student39	1	"All the proposals that I have read so far we almost reverse of what I did in mine. I focused a lot of the project methodology and solution description and very briefly described the tasks necessary to complete the project. What I am seeing in other people's projects is less of the background and more details on the task. This particular proposal is along those lines as well. I really liked the detailed descriptions of tasks and specifications, however I personally prefer to see more on methodology. I do not have much background in the Educational Technologies so it is hard for me to asses the value of the proposed project especially on how it compares to existing ones. Nonetheless the idea is great. One advice that I recommend everyone (since I do not see anyone mention that): -- include information on how are you going to evaluate the success of the project. Will that be through collecting user feedback? Would it be more programmatic assessment?"	10/3/2015 10:44	2834		
Student72	Student22	1	"Being a software engineer myself and having participated in many programming classes over the year I believe that a study like what you propose could be helpful to the technical education community in improving the delivery of programming training. I look forward to rea[lastname]g the results of your study. I would suggest that you take the time to estimate hours of work for each the tasks you have defined. The suggested number of hours per student is 100. I wonder if you may find you have committed to many more hours of work than that. Just something to consider this week as you are tuning your proposal for the final proposal. Also, I would suggest that you consider developing a set of specific observations that you can score for all students regardless of age to get some data that can be easily compared across age groups. Personally I would be interested to hear if there is a correlation between the type and number of programs that the students of a course are required to write and how well the students feel they learned the language. Good luck with your project. In general, I like what you are proposing, but I do feel you may want to narrow the focus some if possible."	9/29/2015 20:31	3621		
Student72	Student46	1	"I think this is a good start and fine as a first draft, but it needs more detail added for the final draft. I would suggest you add a section that describes the games play in detail. This would essen[firstname]lly be your set of use cases, sort of. Also, more detail is needed on the tasks you plan to accomplish each week along with time estimates for those tasks, so you can have a good idea if the workload is reasonable or not. As a developer myself, I would not be surprised to find that the creation of the images you will be using in your game end up taken a considerable amount of time if you have to create them yourself. From experience it seems that getting the look right can be an exhausting process. So, maybe be ok with a very minimal GUI and if you have time later on spice it up. Good luck. I hope to get to see it when you're done."	9/29/2015 21:31	945	7	
Student72	Student82	0	"I like your project idea and look forward to seeing your final presentation. I have a couple of observations I would like to share. First, you have your workload estimates in days. I'm sure you're not planning on working all day. It would be a good idea to try an be more specific about the time you expect to spend doing each task, probably in hours. You're probably thinking you just do whatever it takes to finish the task in the week you have allocated, but with more exact estimates you may find you are either over or under loa[lastname]g yourself which may help distribute the workload more evenly. Also, if you don't have an experience with the Sent2Vec encoder you may need to allocate some time getting past the learning curve required to be productive with the tool. Maybe the learning curve is minor, maybe not. In my project I'm using a 2D game engine that I've never used before (actually I've never used any 2D game engine :) so I put some time in the plan for just learning how to get started. Good luck with your project. Sounds really cool."	9/29/2015 22:12	221		
Student72	Student49	2	"Good job so far. For the final proposal I would suggest a detailed break-down of workload estimates. Maybe try to limit tasks sizes to 10 hours or less. I'm only saying this because this project seems quite ambitious to me. Also, you might want to develop a set of use cases that will help guide development in prioritizing tasks, so that you complete the most important use cases first and maybe drop some if you run out of time. Good luck with your project. I look forward to seeing it in action. :)"	9/29/2015 22:16	1325		
Student59	Student26	2	"Great job! I really liked your detailed comparisons against the existing solutions on the [firstname]et. This shows that you understand the problem well, and have done some solid research to understand where current offerings come up short. I also though the prioritization of features for the instructor and student aspects of the project was great. I believe this will help greatly with the project. I did start to feel a bit anxious when I got to your technology section. No issues with the specific technologies listed, but it did drive home how complex this system truly is (though no more so than any other modern day web app). Hopefully everyone on your team is well versed in software development methodologies and understands how to successfully deliver a project at this scale. Overall, though, excellent work. I wish more project documents I encountered in my day-to-day work were done with this level of care and detail!"	9/29/2015 21:35	1252	5	"This was interesting. We have a few technological things in the mix which are brand new to both of us (selenium especially). Besides that I think the rest is just pretty standard web these days. I had this conversation with [firstname] on day 1, how _some_ CS professors and students tend to downplay the web as something less than, i dunno C/C++ assembly (you get the drift); but if you really think about it in terms of what you are working with, web is extremely rich an complex and has so much depth in terms of how you can implement web apps. Then you add scalability and distributed servers in the mix and yes, there's nothing really simple about it at that point."
Student59	Student5	0	"Definitely some good parts of this proposal. Your schedule and work breakdown appears very detailed, and it seems that you have the technologies identified and handled. However, after rea[lastname]g through this twice, I must say that I am not quite certain what you are buil[lastname]g. I understand the problem (resources are too scattered), but I'm not getting how you are fixing it. Rea[lastname]g through the draft API spec offers some clues, but I would like to see this presented in another way. For your final draft, you might consider putting yourself in the position of the user, and describing how he or she would go about answering a common OMSCS question using your tool. Something like this might help communicate the nature of the tool more clearly, making for a stronger proposal. It is clear that your team has a good technology background, so I am excited to see how this comes out!"	9/29/2015 21:56	589		
Student59	Student70	1	"Amazing soun[lastname]g project. I think you understand the problem well, and this sounds like a good solution that has the poten[firstname]l to make a difference. However, I would suggest reorganizing this proposal. Starting off with the team members and task list before learning about the problem makes for a confusing rea[lastname]g experience. In fact, rea[lastname]g the paper from bottom to top was a better experience than rea[lastname]g top to bottom. The addition of some simple UI mockups demonstrating the use of the app (even if they aren't final designs) would also help better communicate the design and intent of the project. Otherwise, good work!"	9/29/2015 22:07	427	6	
Student59	Student78	2	"Great proposal. I appreciated the good overview of existing solutions. Your description of each of the models (domain, student, tutor) was concise yet informative. You've identified what appears to be a well graduated system of hinting and encouragement. This, along with the flowchart, helped me understand what you are trying to accomplish here. I do believe you have your work cut out for you in designing each of your models. You are attempting to model abstract thoughts and connections into a representation that your tutor model can make decisions about. I notice this design takes much of your project time, which definitely seems appropriate! I think it is also smart that you are keeping the technology aspect well within your comfort zone: this will allow you to make more progress in the ITS space than you would otherwise. Nice job!"	9/29/2015 22:14	906		
Student92	Student98	1	Can't wait to see the presentation!	9/29/2015 22:13	678	6	Seems like I left out a lot in the project proposal- first draft. The feedback mentioned above will be ironed out in the final draft for the proposal. I still have not decided if the project will be research or a tool but I'm learning more towards research now. Thanks
Student92	Student28	2	"This is a well-thought out plan. I love the idea of decoupling the data from the websites themselves into RESTful endpoints. This could make a great buil[lastname]g block for others to build on top of. I would love to see not only OMCS more centralized, but my undergraduate college had a ton of accounts for us to remember login/passwords/addresses for."	9/29/2015 22:27	214	6	
Student92	Student38	2	Looks solid to me! Looking forward to seeing it implemented.	9/29/2015 22:31	1148	6	
Student92	Student85	2	"Well-written and clear. My friend was CTO of a startup selling (quite successfully) a product that had a much smaller scope than your project. It looks like a very useful product, so I wish you the best of luck!"	9/29/2015 22:56	1301		
Student82	Student88	2	"Sounds like an interesting project! Other than minor spelling (choosen instead of chosen) and grammatical errors, it looks like a solid proposal."	9/29/2015 23:05	303		
Student82	Student49	2	"Great list and explanation of technologies to use and architecture diagram! I love the idea. At one company I worked at we had a suggestion box where any employee could make any comment about anything. The CEO would read the ones he liked each month. If an employee's idea was picked to be implemented, the employee received a $50 bonus. This sounds like a SaaS version of the suggestion box with some extra features."	9/29/2015 23:10	284		
Student82	Student22	2	Very detailed task list!	9/29/2015 23:15	142		
Student82	Student42	1	The task list and calendar should follow the other sections of the proposal.	9/29/2015 23:17	93		
Student52	Student5	0	"Very impressive first draft for your proposal. It looks like your group was thorough in detail throughout the entire proposal. I feel like you included all the relevant information within this one proposal, such that it was not required to have read any of your previous papers to understand the issue your addressing and how your plan to address it. This proposal sounds very appealing to me, primarily because I would benefit from the work, so thank you for your team efforts towards this project! I know that future OMSCS students would benefit from a project like this as well. I only came up with two questions and I apologize if you already addressed them in the proposal. Will iReady be accessible from mobile devices and user-friendly on those platforms? Also, do you have any plans on suggested course paths so that students can specify their current skill set (i.e. C programming, Security, Algorithms, etc.) so that those related courses would show as recommendations for the next semester? Really great work and attention to detail! I look forward to hearing and seeing more about iReady throughout this course. Great work!"	9/29/2015 23:01	1106		
Student52	Student59	1	"I was really interested to hear about all of the existing Python packages available to use for your prototype. That must be reassuring for you to know that the foundational tools already exist and now it�s a matter of investing time to develop the prototype itself. Good idea on using your CS7641 trial and error experience to help develop this tool for teachers as well. The only question I came up with is how do you plan to allow teachers to use this tool since it�s developed specifically for them? This may be out of the scope of your project, and I apologize if it is, but I was curious nonetheless. Besides that, I think you really did a great job of describing your project in detail and have a solid plan to make this tool a reality. Good luck and I look forward to hearing more about this project throughout the class!"	9/29/2015 23:20	869		
Student52	Student87	1	"What a great idea as a project proposal! I have thought about a solution like this many times and was curious if someone in the class would tackle it. There was another group that has some similarities to this project, but I did not gather from their proposal that they were actually inclu[lastname]g any sort of recommendation engine. This type of solution is really exciting and I think (and hope) that you would be able to generate a lot of feedback to help build the engine. A couple resources that come to mind are, obviously, Piazza to get class feedback directly from those in the Education Technology course, perhaps use Piazza for any other classes that you are currently enrolled in, and also the Google+ page for OMSCS- https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108902554607547634726. There are a lot of folks from OMCS on this page, so that might be a good place to ask for help with gathering data. For the survey portion of your project, do you plan to use the questionnaires that are available on the OMSCS course description pages? These might be helpful in buil[lastname]g out the part of the project that helps the student make a better decision on whether they have the necessary skills to enroll in the class. Below are some examples: http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6300-software-development-process/ http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-artificial-intelligence-robotics/ I�ve seen mention of SciKit a few times now between your proposal and others. It sounds like that may be a tool used or learned from another course within OMSCS. If so, that�s great to build upon the skillset your acquiring in the program already. Great work on your proposal and I look forward to hearing more about the success of this project!"	9/29/2015 23:35	1121		
Student52	Student71	2	"Interesting project topic! I know very little about this realm that your group is diving into, so it�s exciting to learn about some of the tools already available and how you plan to make them more readily available as an iPad app. I was really blow away by the sheer amount of information you provided in your project proposal and at the level of detail of the documentation itself. I think, if anything, your team has nailed the documentation portion of the project. At this point I actually don�t have any suggestions to provide or questions to ask. Great work to you and your team! Good luck and I really hope to hear more about the success of this project throughout the course."	9/29/2015 23:53	680	6	
Student6	Student91	1	"This seems like a very ambitious project. I didn't see any group members mentioned anywhere, do you have any concerns about the size of the project? What does TAG stand for? The acronym is introduced but not defined. How do you plan on dealing with content that has been updated since last viewed by the user? You are planning on asking your mentor for suggestions as to which programming language you should use. If your code is running on the client machine, that will be a bigger factor in choosing a language, in my opinion. Good luck!"	9/29/2015 22:55	2532	7	
Student6	Student101	1	"I found your mission statement awkwardly worded. There is no mention of research done in the area. There doesn't appear to be any activities scheduled the last few weeks of the course, is that imcomplete?"	9/29/2015 23:38	607	2	
Student6	Student47	1	"It is an interesting subject area. But you do not give any detail as to what you have done to date, and very little detail as to how you will compile data throughout the term. I did appreciate the fact that you provided the search terms and sources of information that you will be searching. You throw in a classroom management plan into the schedule if you have time. There is little introduction or substance to this item. It does seem to be an appropriately sized project for the term, I think a few more details will need to be fleshed out. Good luck!"	9/29/2015 23:48	730		
Student6	Student33	1	"The main question I have is, will low-income families even have access to the resources to learn programming? I guess, even what definition of low-income are you using? Based on the mentor comments, I do not see any fallback plan if you have difficulty getting your data. There are no hard dates specified to when the tasks you have listed need to be completed by. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 0:00	2227	7	Thanks for the feedback. I will take this into consideration as we prepare the final draft.
Student14	Student53	1	"I didn't really see the method component in your proposal - it was one of the requirements of the assignment. Perhaps I'm overlooking it. Other than that, it looks good."	9/30/2015 2:22	106		
Student14	Student76	2	Great job! You are consistent and deliver quality work. I did get frustrated with the appendix - my mouse would scroll and I would end up in the middle of the appendix. I didn't realize it was your past assignments. Good idea though.	9/30/2015 2:24	134		
Student14	Student95	2	Really cool! Would you make instructions for others to use for students? (go Adafruit!) You may be able to get some of those supplies for cheap if you still have Radio Shack around. Some surroun[lastname]g area locations are finally closing down.	9/30/2015 2:26	908

Student85	Student16	0	"Jeff, your project write-up is clear and concise and I feel like I understand what you are trying to achieve. My understan[lastname]g is that the project proposal should include most/all of the material we've written up so far and as I recall your past papers were considerably more detailed than this one, so I'm of the belief that this assignment should be inclusive of that work, the idea being that we've been buil[lastname]g up to this final paper that is equal parts problem space research, sales pitch, and project plan. But I could be completely wrong."	9/30/2015 7:22	343	5	
Student85	Student98	0	"[firstname], the first two-thirds of this paper seems to be a reformatted version of the course schedule that doesn't supply any information about what work/deliverables might (or might not) be scheduled for a given week. I also believe the proposal should include details about your prior analysis of the problem space, citations of existing research in the area, and a persuasive argument about why your project could be important. I assume you've considered the question, ""What will motivate underachieving students to enter data into the application?"" and I'd want to see the answer to that question here because, honestly, I don't see it happening. IMO this is a project with great poten[firstname]l but as defined its success hinges on a faulty premise, namely that these students care enough to spend time with the tool. Success would be more likely, again in my opinion, if you were to pursue gradebook integration as a data source."	9/30/2015 7:28	660		
Student85	Student17	2	"[firstname], in my opinion this is a very well thought out project and very well written project proposal - great job! I would suggest a little more depth in the discussion of the application's features since you are writing directly to users of the existing application and it might help to explain how current use cases would work in the to-be world as well as elaborate on what new use cases the application will be able to support. As a poten[firstname]l user of your application, a few questions/comments come to mind. First, in the area of deci[lastname]g what topics/channels need to be paid attention to, have you considered a Stack Overflow-like model of voting on what's good/useful? Piazza allows instructors to flag a good note and some rudimentary up-voting, but it's not done in a useful way... Second, with regard to private chat/messages, there are a couple of poten[firstname]l pitfalls to consider. Piazza's flat structure leads to problems fin[lastname]g information, but it also provides the benefit of having everything available. Private messages work against this and could lead to a lower quality of discourse in the public forums. Also, private messages/chat could lead to better students being bombarded with questions/problems of those doing less well, which would not be fair to them. Third, a question: Where do new topics come from? Are these hard-wired by the instructors? Or can students create them? Finally, where do private messages fit into the app? You mention them but I did not understand from the proposal how they would fit into the final application."	9/30/2015 7:39	1209		
Student85	Student36	0	"[firstname], I don't I think I understand what your project is about. A couple of basic things are not clear in this writeup, such as: What are myOLE and IRB? I'm not familiar with either of those applications and I doubt if most readers are. You say that ""The goal of the research is to determine what the benefits and detriments for each tool using a series of metrics, and aggregate the successful feature qualities into meaningful implementation requirements..."", which sounds promising, but there is no mention of what metrics you propose to use or what criteria you might use to decide which metrics are important, which leads me to wonder what your ultimate end-game is for the project. As a side note, I would suggest that what has made Stack Overflow successful is: A) a reasonable level of curating/censorship; and B) the voting system. Piazza does not do a good job at the latter and OMSCS TAs are not active in the former, in my experience."	9/30/2015 7:59	991	5

Student95	Student24	2	"Wow, this seems like a really neat project. Being a DB programmer for 20 years (VB and sqlserver) I am interested in the frameworks you chose because I have never used them. I will check them out. This looks like an ambitious project and it looks very useful. Almost like a dating app! Good luck."	9/30/2015 7:43	799	6	"Thanks [firstname]. The reason I am choosing these technologies is that they are readily available open source technologies and highly scalable/extensible in nature , so that it is easy to adopt when the scope of the project increases."
Student95	Student50	1	Looks good. You clearly defined what you wanted to do and how you were going to go about doing it. I think this data will be very valuable to GaTech. Good luck with your project.	9/30/2015 7:57	258		
Student95	Student58	2	"Very well thought out document. Seems like you two have a great idea of what you want to accomplish and how. The only thing that I had trouble with in your proposal is there were some acronyms that I could not figure out (ICT, ET, CITI, LASSO, PCA, ICA, etc). Defining those would be good for the reader. Also, I just read another proposal from Student50 where she is interested in retention rates of OMSCS. Her data/reasearch might be useful to your project or vice versa.

Student67	Student63	1	"Hi Yi-Chen, I think you present quite an interesting solution of using an introductory and evaluation game to assess the student (or user). My main concern with this type of game-based approaches has always seemed to be for me on how subtle is the evaluation part of the game. I don�t really like to be assess when I start any game, I want that to happen organically as I play a game. The system should be learning my behavior and skills on an ongoing basis. Essen[firstname]lly, If you can make your solution to be engaging and subtle, while running your learning algorithm in the background you may have a �hit� in your proposed solution. Overall, great job. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 8:59	935		
Student67	Student53	1	"Hi All, First of all, good job on selecting this problem to solve. I was shocked to read how children in low socioeconomic status home hear 30 million fewer words, when compare to other children. Now, the way you are all tackling the problem via a mobile app is a good way to solve it. Probably, I would have gone that route as well but as you all may have seen, there are quite a few apps out there in the educational sector and most lack that �easy of use� component. In addition, they lack a web interface to go with their apps. This is of course not a �must have�, but the web serves also an important medium. For example, in your app, when you all mentioned, �Ideally, teachers could also have the ability to load custom vocabulary lists to accompany specific texts or thematic units to accompany their instruction.� This is a good place where the web would be an easier medium to this task. In addition, I am wondering if you guys can leverage the Ionic framework so you all develop the code and deploy for all the major mobile platforms and not just focus on Android. Overall, great job, good luck!"	9/30/2015 9:15	1158		
Student67	Student80	1	"Hi Student80, Very nice proposal! First of all, the problem you are trying to tackle is a good one (I�ve been a victim of �freeloaders� in group projects in the past) :) Anyway, I think the tool you are trying to use to capture the data you need should be enough to come up with some sort of conclusion but the problem of freeloaders I think it�s more involved. Different factors need to be taken into account. For example, group sizes, types of classes, how big the project is, etc. I know this is not exactly the data you are trying to capture now but it�s worth giving it a thought and see if somehow you can incorporate those in your results. Overall, great job, good luck!"	9/30/2015 9:34	1166		
Student67	Student97	1	"Hi [firstname], Very good problem you�ve picked to solve! I can�t wait to play around with your solution. I have always been interested in security and think some of the considerations such as being able to �learn from anywhere and anytime�, �provi[lastname]g real-world experience�, �creden[firstname]ls�, etc are good components to have a successful learning online environment. Now, given that we have about 2 months to complete the project, and you will be focusing on web security, what medium will you be developing this project in? web? mobile? If both, will they both have the same sort of design or will each of these mediums focus on different aspects on this learning environment? Also, what makes someone �good� at web security. Will your tool provide some of sort of final test or just completing the online courses/tutorials be enough for someone to feel confident in entering the web security world? Overall, great job, good luck!"	9/30/2015 9:54	872	6	
Student3	Student85	1	"I was incredibly intrigued in your outline until I got to the actual Project Proposal. I completely agree with the problems you address and the solutions you offer (i.e. the U.S. becoming the Leader in Ed Tech). However, I do not think that the creating a digital platform is the answer. I am certain dozens of platforms exist and another hundred in development. To be honest, throwing another on into the mix will not solve the under-utilization of technology in education. I am an IT Director overseeing regional schools and actually used to work for an Ed Tech company that specifically aimed at replacing paper textbooks with high-quality digital content. The company put MILLIONS of dollars into the ongoing development and never found a good stride or successful penetration into the K-12 Industry. Here is the company: http://net-texts.com/. How do you expect to accomplish this as an individual? Since we are very far along in the Proposal phase in this class, understand I am not trying to dissuade you from your objectives. I am just concerned with the feasibility. Have you worked in education in any way? You might find my proposal interesting since it hits a number of your key points in your proposal. It is geared towards the political climate of K-12 Ed Tech. Google Drive link below to the PDF. If you would like to discuss a partnership lets do it sooner than later. I am a one-person team. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6FN6sKv8gHLUXNzbkRISUFzTzA/view?usp=sharing -Email: Student3 Good luck if you pursue the development of this application!"	9/30/2015 9:17	2369	7	"If [firstname] and I had made contact earlier in the semester we could have worked together productively, I think, but at this point I have too much invested in the project to give it up now."
Student3	Student38	1	"The primary focus is on an improved UX, correct? And some minor efficiency improvements? For readability, a GUI mock-up would be beneficial to the reader. Additionally, to better understand the scope of work involved, detailing either percentages or expected hourly commitments would help detail where you plan to spend the most time."	9/30/2015 13:35	10	5	"The GUI mock-up recommendation will be helpful for the progress report, but it and specific time allocations are not appropriate IMO at this stage for this particular project."
Student3	Student28	2	"I apologize for sen[lastname]g this on a Friday. This is what a group proposal should look like. This has incredible poten[firstname]l and can poten[firstname]lly be a betterment to the OMSCS population as a whole. The amount of detail into the planning part of this proposal is clear and thoughtfully written. In terms of readability, maybe split the long paragraph in the Overview into two or three paragraphs. Some run-on sentences and missing commas are present but grammar isn't critical here. I believe I have asked this before to a team member but, do you envision this to be something used by the Georgia Tech administration? Say, a resource through Buzzport? I clear challenge may be segmenting Current vs Prospective students. Obviously, prospective students can't log-in to Buzzport. But at the same time, you need to ensure the Honor Code is enforce as well. How will you solve this? Honestly, as an OMSCS student, I tend to just ""wing-it"" and don't spend much time digging for resources. I have never even visited the G+ page actually don't really plan to. Best of luck and I hope to be a happy product user in the future!"	10/2/2015 8:22	1333		
Student3	Student92	1	"First of all, I apologize for sen[lastname]g this on Friday. The demand for Computer Science graduates is already outpacing demand; the forecast is that it will only continue to rise. As a quick pointer, you should proofread for grammar. I got lost a few times on both the sentence descriptions and bulleted list. I have used CodeAcademy and am part of the 72%. As you pointed out, this is only because I got to a point that I couldn't progress. I was stuck and didn't know how to proceed despite working pretty diligently on trying to figure out why (I was taking a refresher Python course even though I knew Python previously). This annoyance caused me to never visit the site thereafter. I am not sure if this is common (or how much of a % that this actually takes up) but this should be something to consider: What type of support will your learners have if they simply can't progress? It appears that you will have dedicated instructors to Students. So, is this something that is to be used explicitly in a classroom scenario or an application that anyone could use on the web? If used in a classroom, why would a Teacher use your product over CodeAcademy? If students get stuck in CA, they could help them directly; compared to my scenario. If used online, will you have a support team to reach out to students? If support is going to be the cornerstone of your platform, consider how that aspect will [firstname]et you over the numerous other platforms."	10/2/2015 8:45	1110

Student18	Student93	2	Hi Student93 Your proposal is very detailed and very well documented. I never thought about using educational technology to help people with medical conditions. Your idea is really inspiring. I have understood the general idea of your project and the final outcome. It was a bit difficult for me to grasp various models you have presented. I would suggest ad[lastname]g a small summary of your work at the start. It will put the reader in context before diving into the details. Beside that I don�t find anything to say that could add any value. I am happy to learn something new from your paper. Good luck with you project.	9/30/2015 13:51	107	7	Finally a good advice to n vague description of the models
Student18	Student39	2	"Hi SmarterAP Team You have a great idea and a very well documented project plan. Few points that come to my mind are - I am getting the impression that instructors won�t have facility to add new questions to the system. They have to choose questions already available in the test bank. So who will have the role to maintain and keep test bank updated? - You have mentioned that SmarterAP will provide fully featured functionality not available in other assessment tools. I will suggest ad[lastname]g a small comparison matrix here so reader can easily find what makes SmarterAP unique compared to other tools. - You mentioned students will receive feedback on their performance. Is it going to be a built in feature of SmarterAP? How is it going to work? - How you will test this solution in a live setting? How this could be implemented, by whom and how they will use it? Overall, great project plan and good luck with your project."	10/1/2015 8:25	112		
Student18	Student37	1	"Hi Team You have a great idea and a very well documented project plan. Few points that come to my mind are - Under �weakness of existing solutions� you mentioned that your solution aims to be organic to everyday work. Can you please elaborate it more and explain what is unique about your solution and how end user will interact with system in everyday work. - How your system will manage the duplication of ideas and knowledge? If all employees will have access and will be able to push their ideas into system it could lead to duplication of ideas and knowledge in the system. - You mentioned to track all submissions through the process. Who is going to define this process? Is it built into the process or submitter will have the facility to define this process. - You mentioned that the system must identify & enable the team to reach out to the appropriate subject matter experts. Please elaborate it more on how your system will implement and facilitate in this regard. - How you will test this solution in a live setting? How this could be implemented in an organization, by whom and how they will use it? Overall, great project plan and good luck with your project."	10/1/2015 21:06	121		
Student18	Student54	1	"Hi [firstname] You have a very inspiring idea. From your paper I understand that your solution works by comparing the given text with its stored data. Like comparing the new submission with all previous assignment submissions stored in the database. But there are cases in which students copy text from online sources like Wikipedia or code from GitHub. How is your solution going to handle such cases? Also I am thinking that as your solution effectiveness is directly dependent on its stored material it might take long time to get matured and be useful? One final thought, how you will test this solution in a live setting? How this could be implemented in an organization, by whom and how they will use it? Overall, great project plan and good luck with your project."	10/1/2015 22:25	23		
Student41	Student47	1	"I believe that I reviewed one of your earlier assignments and I still find this topic to be very interesting. What I'm wondering about is whether the sources you've cited will have datasets related to rates of disruptive behavior and whether those studies were conducted in both technology-based and traditional classroom management classrooms. In other words, are you going to be able to compare the rates of disruptive behavior in both types of classrooms? Going further, are those existing studies going to have broken down the different types of technology-based classroom management techniques for the sake of comparing their effectiveness? It's been awhile since I've been in a K-12 classroom and it sounds as though many classrooms are based on the ""flipped classroom"" style in which students are participating in active learning. Does technology-based classroom management exist in both active and passive learning environments? Are the techniques similar? Having reviewed the Google Cardboard project, I'm wondering if the use of VR in the classroom would affect student behavior. Seems like kids who aren't looking at each other wold be less interested in disrupting the class if they didn't receive any visual affirmation that their antics are getting laughs. Really hoping that we get to review these projects down the road as this is very interesting subject matter."	9/30/2015 15:40	1742		
Student41	Student101	1	"My question after rea[lastname]g this is, ""How are you measuring which methodologies worked best?"" Is there a common assessment that is measuring the success (or failure) of the different methodologies used or will the success of any methodology be based on the instructor's self-assessment of the methodology? Based on your description of the survey, it sounds like the success of a methodology may be self-reported, which is fine, but it's also subjective. Also, I wonder if your focus may be a little too broad. ""Technology"" is such a large topic area, that it may be difficult to find research results that are comparable. Perhaps with a slightly narrower focus, maybe something like the use of multimedia in class, you be able to compare methodologies that have similar goals. It's definitely an interesting area of research, though, and I wish you well with it."	10/1/2015 10:14	12	7	
Student41	Student6	2	"[firstname], this sounds like a great use of the SIMAC tool. While I know nothing about linacs, I have done a fair share of software training. I guess my question to you would be related to the error conditions. Are learners going to need any context related to an error condition or do these error conditions occur independent of external variables? If there are external symptoms of a problem, how might you integrate that into your error condition? Sometimes it's necessary to give a learner a little more context for why an error condition is occurring. I've used fabricated engineer logs designed to help a learner determine the genesis of an issue. Sometimes external factors like weather or power outages might be related to the error condition. Basically, I'm creating a scenario in which a problem exists and the learner needs to determine from the clues why the error is occurring and then remedy the issue. If there are no external symptoms or context necessary, ignore everything you just read. ;-) I did find this academic paper (http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/THERAC25.html) that listed some historical linac accidents. In those six accidents, there were verbal cues from the patient that something had gone wrong. I wonder if you can incorporate that into your error conditions. Good luck with your project. Sounds like poten[firstname]lly life-saving training."	10/1/2015 10:55	2226	7	I think this is the first time that someone has suggested a paper as part of the feedback. The feedback was relevant and gave me some additional items to think about.
Student41	Misc3	1	"It's interesting, but I just reviewed Student6's proposal which includes a very similar system (albeit for linear accelerators). Creating a safe ""sandbox"" for learners to make mistakes via application-based learning is an excellent choice of projects. His was more centered on troubleshooting error conditions, but the random nature of his scena[lastname] was similar. Great work on the comprehensive nature of this proposal. I wonder if a tool like this has a place in Higher Ed. You mentioned the skill gap that exists for recent graduates and I wonder if a tool like this would be an appropriate tool for a student near graduation. I realize you need to implement a limited scope because of time constraints, but I wonder if you could build your RSG in such a way that it's extensible for future users to add their own components. An open source solution like that could lead to a really robust learning tool. Good luck with utilizing all of the different technical components. It's a large project to attempt, but the educational uses are quite obvious."	10/1/2015 12:49	34		
Student73	Student79	1	Very nice work! Great job on the theoretical foundation. I love foreign language so am very interested to try this out (email j[lastname]@gmail.com if you need a beta tester). I think you could do a little better job describing your MVP - I'm having a little difficulty figuring out when quizzes come up and exactly how it works so maybe some additional detail would help.	9/30/2015 20:59	370	6	
Student73	Student60	1	This is a very cool and ambitious project. Very good work on the proposal. Will questions be predefined or can teachers create their own? I would love to see more information in here regar[lastname]g the group formation engine. This seems like a major component of the project but is kind of a huge black box right now. Do you have some ideas of how it will actually do the matching? If you need a beta tester let me know (j[lastname]@gmail.com).	9/30/2015 21:05	351	6	The feedback was good. Offer of beta testing is overwhelming. :)
Student73	Student81	1	Very cool project idea. Might be good to expound a little more on specific ideas for scena[lastname] that you would like to test if you do gain access to a HoloLens. Looking forward to seeing the results!	9/30/2015 21:11	193	5	
Student73	Student29	1	"Very interesting project and well written proposal. As teachers I think you are well positioned to gather this data. Your list of questions is good, I do wonder if it would be useful to narrow the focus a little bit as answering all those questions seems difficult. As a sometimes CS teacher I am very interested to see the final result."	9/30/2015 21:14	559		
Student53	Student97	1	"Hi [firstname], the proposal looks good, here are some mostly minor things that I would consider [lastname]ing for the final proposal: - Add the hours estimate to the proposal, to make sure that it is close to the suggested [firstname] of 100 hours. - I would remove the team member section, it is implicit - Maybe also include some fallback plans as to what will be implemented in case your original scope cannot be completed. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 22:41	828	6	
Student53	Student40	2	"Hi [firstname], this looks great, from the conciseness to the formatting and covering all the parts requested. Everything is very clear. In regards to the project, what a great opportunity implementing this at your the university you work on, this one of those projects that very likely will live beyond the course. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 22:55	691	6	Thanks [firstname]!
Student53	Student43	1	"Hi [firstname], In my opinion the task breakdown looks good. Might be tricky/time consuming getting more specific for each task at this point and then things might [lastname]e once you reach them. However there were a couple of tasks that I wasn't sure what they were about, so maybe you can expand on those in the design part, those were: the ones related to ""Build Customer"" and ""Build Player"". I like the vision of your project (had already seen it in a previous peer feedback), and I think it is a good idea to start with the Microsoft platform before doing full VR, specially due to our time constraint. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 23:07	1125	6	
Student53	Student8	1	"Hi Chris, As a personal preference I would usually add a few more subsections within each section. Like for example in the design part I would've split the stories. Makes it a bit easier to follow while rea[lastname]g I think. Another think you might want to add is a fallback plan in case something comes up, like for example an unforeseen issue with the tools you are using. Overall the project and proposal look great, autism is one of the causes that is gaining more visibility lately so I do see this project becoming something helpful in the near future. Good luck!"	9/30/2015 23:26	1126		
Misc3	Student33	1	"I'm really interested in the outcome because I've worked with some low-income students before. One question is how would you compensate for negative feedback that was generated due to the software in question (and not necessarily the idea of using software). The reverse may also be true, a positive response due to a specific feature or features in the software that were integral to the experience."	10/1/2015 0:15	242	7

Misc3	Student47	1	I have several coworkers whose wives are teachers in the K-12 and a common discussion point is technology in the classroom. Its given me a little background and I can appreciate the significance of this topic. I look forward to seeing your final paper. Only comment on the tasks/milestones is to add hours. That'll help in ensuring the scope is within the 100 hours for a one person project and help plan your weeks.	10/3/2015 15:39	171		
Student37	Student92	1	"Great breakdown of tasks, good description of your idea, and overall a nice problem to tackle. I wouldn't underestimate the fact that codeacademy is a learning tool though as it contribute to its retention issues. People are usually keen to try out something before they commit to it, and the last thing most people will commit to is learning in general. Maybe find out some way to reward commitment to your tool, something codeacademy does not do."	10/1/2015 14:31	184		
Student37	Student93	1	"SO MUCH BACKGROUND INFORMATION. So if i'm rea[lastname]g this right, despite the science, what you are trying to do is model (with fabricated data) the behavior you want to observe, visualize the shifts in cognitive states, and create rules to handle those? I'm not sure what your overall goal is here, or how you would measure success. For those less inclined to read all of that science in there, you might want to drop a very clear paragraph in there near the end that gives a summary of what you want to do, why you want to do it, and what you hope to achieve by doing it."	10/1/2015 14:34	906	6	
Student37	Student39	2	"3/3 for that beautiful table of tasks. I like the idea, for i too suffered through Comp Sci AP and in fact did terrible on the exam (although that is mostly because it was all handwritten).

Student42	Student100	1	The proposed project seems to do a good job of addressing the issue of a flexible autograder for html/css projects. The introduction and existing technologies sections both allude to a broader need for these tools beyond static html/css content. It would be interesting to see some thoughts about how your approach might be later extended to address this broader need.	10/1/2015 21:13	1947		
Student42	Student88	1	"Seems like a worthwhile endeavor. Aside from the couple of examples you gave, how do you plan on identifying what features you want to address for visualization, and how are you planning on measuring the effectiveness of the visualizations in improving user experience once you have completed your product?"	10/1/2015 21:45	1367		
Student42	Student45	1	"As pointed out in your proposal, there is a wealth of information contained in a variety of sources, and there will no doubt continue to be people who continue to contribute valuable information via those forums, social networking tools, etc even with the existence of a better tool, which you're developing.

Student46	Student82	2	"Overall an interesting idea. It seems like you have a plan and did some research. I had a few questions when rea[lastname]g the paper. -Peer gra[lastname]g is not a valid option for the OMS CS program or WGU who must rely on graders. Why is peer gra[lastname]g not a valid option? -Rubrics, along with thresholds for determining the rubric score How will it determine which thresholds are met? I get the concept, but not the implementation. -By using chunked excerpts per rubric item from exemplary assignments Can't a paper be great, but deviate greatly from what has already been done? How would this algorithm handle that case? You use the term ""skip-thought vectors"" a lot, but the definition felt fuzzy throughout the paper. -The skip-thought vector space model will address this issue by checking for semantic relatedness. The intent is to identify thoughts that are similar to thoughts in exemplary papers. Can't original thoughts (thoughts which deviate from the chunked example) still be great thoughts? I'm not sure how the overall concept addresses good papers which differ from the given examples. Can your model handle this?"	10/1/2015 21:58	490	6	"Peer gra[lastname]g is not valid at the academic level because the person gra[lastname]g it needs to understand what is being graded. Would you want your paper to be graded by a C student or an overcritical A student? If a rubric has the possibility of rating an item 0 - 5 then the cutoffs for semantic relatedness would be : 5 - 100% related 4 - 80% 3 - 60% 2 - 40% 1 - 20% 0 - 0% I may adjust the above thresholds, but that is the assumption I will be starting with. Yes. That is one of the known limitations. How can I identify an exemplary assignment? That is mentioned, albeit briefly, in the paper. I do not have the answer for that currently and I probably won't by the end of the semester. Hopefully someone smarter than me, and with more time than one semester, can figure that out later. That's a great question, and one of my own. My hypothesis is that it will, but the whole of point of doing the research is to prove that it can, or at least to identify how effective this method is."
Student46	Student49	2	It looks like a clear plan is laid out and that you have a solid idea. It sounds like this tool can really promote collaboration and innovation.	10/1/2015 22:07	332		
Student46	Student22	1	"Sounds like quite an interesting study you have going on. A lot of the learning I got while learning computer science was from the take home assignments. Actually writing code and working on a problem always seemed like a great way to learn and this type of learning lends itself to remote learning. From hiring students straight out of college the type of learning they get on the job is very different. I think on the job learning is almost always very different from the type of learning at school. I don't know if you will be touching on this when looking at the post-grad programmer, but its an interesting topic. I hope to see the outcomes of this study!"	10/1/2015 22:12	215		
Student46	Student42	1	"It sounds like you have a plan and a great idea. I understand the concept, but not the implementation. What will the user actually be seeing, doing, hearing, etc? I felt like the core of this idea wasn't fleshed out yet. ""The application will be touch compatible and also recognize and will utilize a combination of voice, text and graphical communication to test users on targeted vocabulary lists"" I get that it is an app and what the goal of the app is. But how it will actually teach anything seems fuzzy at this point. In the next iteration of the project description I hope this is made more clear as it seems crucial."	10/1/2015 22:16	304

I think you could improve in terms of implementation details (what language will you use? how will the user interact with the project?). In addition, are there any existing solutions for this project or are you pioneering uncharted territory? I know that you are buil[lastname]g upon existing frameworks but have other people done that before? If so, did they have any success? If not, what factors in your research made you think there was a demand for your project? Best of luck going forward!"	10/2/2015 7:43	1783		
Student66	Student83	1	"This is a great hypothesis, this kind of reminds me of the line of thought that our ""education"" gives kids knowledge but doesn't teach them how to think. I think teaching diagnostic ability will be a great way to help kids going forward in their education. The only thing I was a bit confused on is how you will use the existing adventure game engine/platform. At one point, you say there will be no integrations with third-party tools or services but wouldn't the existing game engine be a third-party tool? I like the project as a whole, particularly if it is expandable such that anyone can create new scena[lastname] on demand. If your mentor suggests a scope expansion, that might be a cool addition to the project. Great work!"	10/3/2015 13:46	9		
Student66	Student64	1	"I applaud you for choosing this project as this widening gap foreshadows key industry trends in the near future. I think that you have a great plan of attack and are definitely going about data collection in the right way. I also think it's outstan[lastname]g that you are scheduling interviews with industry experts to expand your knowledge. The one thing I would have liked to see more detail on is how you plan to go about the observation phase of your project. Are you going to come up with a curriculum or set of lesson plans to give to some teachers? Or are you going to sit in on already-existing classes to see how teachers are going about teaching programming already? I wasn't sure what your plan was there when I was rea[lastname]g the proposal. Often, one of the biggest problems in lower-income communities is fun[lastname]g and thus those child-focused programming courses simply do not exist. In addition, is your goal to study differences between how children in average income communities and lower income communities approach these programming courses or just one of the communities? Studying the difference between both communities would make an awesome project but would definitely expand the scope significantly. Good luck to you both!"	10/3/2015 13:47	709	6	
Student66	Student12	2	"There is definitely a huge demand for this project amongst the OMSCS community (myself included) so I think you'll find a ready audience if you are considering launching this as a real tool for use beyond just this semester. I thought you provided a great amount of technical detail on implementation although you may want to create some documentation (disgusting, I know..) on all of the different interacting parts. Even a rough sketch will keep you from going insane later. The questions I have for you in terms of the project itself are (1) how do you plan to establish authenticity of students? Will this be hooked up to the GT backend so people would have to login to make contributions? (2) How do you plan on getting grade statistics for the various courses? I encourage you to reach out to students in this class on Piazza for requirement gathering. You might find some interesting use cases and perhaps some things you hadn't thought of. Best of luck! This will be awesome if you pull it off!"	10/3/2015 13:58	763		
Student26	Student54	1	"Hello [firstname], I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your proposal. It was well organized and your plan of action was clear. Here are my comments: - I would have wanted to read more on how you plan to handle the plagiarism detection part; if it's already handled by the existing E-assign, then discuss what they do to detect plagiarism - The comments about ownership of data and student access to third party tools were valid; however my understan[lastname]g is machine learning requires a large data pool to work effectively (here I assume the detection algorithm uses ML). What are some concerns about limiting this solution to OMSCS material and how will that affect the detection algorithm? The course library will be small. What if student uses non-OMSCS source to plagiarize. Would the tool detect that as a positive hit? - ""A course library is the complete collection of associated canons for a specific institution"" I wasn't sure what you meant by associated canon - What is the plan for handling different submission formats from a technical standpoint? Also, PDF can be tricky to read especially if the underlying data is images converted to PDF e.g. if you scan a document, visually it appears as text but really is images. My experience is it's pretty easy to generate PDF, doing anything with a PDF is a whole next level of difficulty - recommendation: set up your staging environment early and do test push to make sure you have no issues deploying; this will save you from poten[firstname]l trouble later if you build the whole app first and only then try to deploy and find out something's not working. - recommendation: for doc upload try dropzone.js, I use it at my work. Even with that expect this to take about a 1- 2 days to implement with the server backend. Very good choice with AWS, I think cloud storage is definitely the way to go here."	10/2/2015 9:03	2317		
Student26	Student18	1	"Hello [firstname], I enjoyed rea[lastname]g you proposal as I had reviewed it earlier and it is nice to see the progress you have made and how you have streamlined the idea. Good job. Here are my comments on your proposal: Regar[lastname]g concerns for self-report methods, my concern is emotional states are very much subjective. My state of happy is probably not same as the next person's because our points of comparison are different. If I was respon[lastname]g to your survey, regular day I would check the middle box. On a better-than-regular day I would check the fourth box. Maybe first and last day of the course I would check the fifth box. Usually I always avoid the most extreme boxes. If I was listening to you give a presentation on your work so far, my first question would be: is there any way to standardize the response scale or is it not necessary to analyze subjectivity in responses (why or why not)? Also, will you assess responses progressively over time, or only current moment in time? BTW I don't know if you have heard this, but cultural background affects the number of options you expect to see in likert scale and how you respond. Here's some discussion on that topic you might find interesting: http://www.surveypractice.org/index.php/SurveyPractice/article/view/224/html I like the idea of using images as a rating scale. Seeing them made me smile. Do you think that will affect the outcome compared to if the options were presented literally? The yellow face seems more appropriate than the human figure. I would not take the human figure very seriously. Is there any plan of how to encourage students to take this survey, or is that up to the instructor to come up with incentives? Especially in cases where student is struggling and not interested in the course. Obviously these are the cases you would want to spot as an instructor."	10/2/2015 9:41	2216		
Student26	Student77	1	"Hello Christina. First, your presentation of the proposal was spectacular. Your application wireframes really helped to visualize the idea and explain it more clearly. Good job. Some general comments: - plan your architecture to support multiple devices from the beginning. I see you mention it, but I just wanted to emphasize it. Maybe think of ad[lastname]g API between Parse and the mobile and write your logic behind the API. - The reason why I was emphasising not relying on mobile so much is because typing posts >10 words on a mobile device is a very tedious. Also think of ways to submit content without typing or maybe having template options to reduce typing. Sorry I just dislike typing on a mobile device a lot (!) which is also why I don't use piazza android app for anything other than rea[lastname]g. - I would have liked to see more on the academic research behind this project. I think you are describing it accurately but expand what you have. Maybe add examples or statistics. In response to your questions (great feature! keep doing this) (1) I am not sure what the sections are exactly. If you are categorizing content make sure if you have e.g. poll with embedded video, the user can find it by looking under either ""poll"" or ""embedded video"". These sections seem context specific. Can the instructors set their own sections? (2) Add some way to notify if there are content updates. Badges with counts for example. (3) No, but I read other peoples' posts. Being able to copy paste url is very important here. Any kind of sharing by button click would be optimal, being able to copy paste is second. Having to type a url is an absolute no way. (4) I don't save on piazza because I can find it later. I use chrome browser as a way to go back to something (search in address bar). If I really really like some article I book[firstname] it or save it locally, though that is very rare."	10/2/2015 10:53	4164		
Student26	Student1	1	"Hello Sam, I enjoyed reviewing your work. I think your topic is interesting and worthy area to research. I have a few suggestions: The 4 questions you identified form a good foundation for your research, but question 1 seems to be the baseline everything else rests on. Maybe reconsider how you present your problem, and state that there's a difference between on-campus and online, and show the backing evidence you have found to validate the statement. Then present the other 3 questions as the problems you are researching and trying to solve. As far as presenting your fin[lastname]gs, you could integrate some statistics and graphs to illustrate the problem. For example you could show comparison of online vs. on-campus withdrawal rates, or add percentages or other quantifiers to the different reasons why people drop out. If you don't have statistics for these then think of other places where you could incorporate num[firstname]al data. If you are able to quantify your fin[lastname]gs and illustrate them, it will help the reader and really show the magnitude of the problem. Just as general questions to consider: - How do you think choosing Reddit users as your population pool will affect the results of the survey. What are reddit user demographics and are they a representative sample of online students in general? - Have you identified any patterns or specific student demographic groups so far? Or are you going to be looking for that? For example do 25-year-olds have same reasons to drop as 45-year-olds? How about men v. women? specific geographic areas? - Also I'm very interested in this term ILMS, do these already exist? BTW the ILMS you describe seems to have some really useful features (student tracking, tutoring etc.). If they don't already exist, why do you think that is? - Do you think your fin[lastname]gs be applicable to on-campus students also? Especially if there are some tools that help reduce drop out rates."	10/2/2015 14:29	2671	7	
Student30	Student80	1	"Hi Student80, I�ve given this a bit of thought � if I am rea[lastname]g your proposal correctly, you are trying to correlate student scores on two games � snowdrift and prisoner�s dilemma with five-point peer meta-feedback scores, and that demonstrating a correlation would be useful in the sense that game scores could be used as a test or indicator of poten[firstname]l peer feedback participation. To put it another way, if students behave �altruistically� in the game, this may be an indicator of �altruistic� behavior in peer feedback, or possibly class participation in general. While I understand the motivation of this design, methodologically I question how well these game outcomes are a predictor of peer feedback behavior, and more to the point how valid the results will be in the sense that I am not sure how a meta-feedback score (similar to a 5-point Likert scale) captures the actual quality, usefulness or effort involved in provi[lastname]g peer feedback. For example, this feedback document � would you rate it quantitatively a 6 or 7, or a 4 or 5? This subjective scale fails to capture the quality of the feedback, I think, in the same way an IQ score quantifies general intelligence into a single number. So, I remain skeptical how valid a correlation would be and how well game scores of this type will be a valid predictor of meta-feedback. In spite of my skepticism, it does however remain an intriguing question � can we design a test that is a useful predictor of the quality of peer reviews a student might provide? BTW, statistically, there is the issue of confoun[lastname]g variables that might also be impacting results, not captured in this experimental design. It does beg the question of whether some other test might be a better predictor � such as a quick IQ test (e.g. memorado.com) or and emotional intelligence test. Alternatively, you could separately test if one game is a better predictor than the other. You may know this but you invited some feedback on the statistics � I agree that a simple Pearson�s correlation coefficient r is the right statistical test in this situation, and note that the idea is the square of r is the value used as the predictor. E.g. if r = .80, then we say that 64 percent of the variance is explained by the predictor variable, and 36 percent of the variance is not explained by the predictor variable, and can be attributed to other factors. Hope this helps, and please let me know if you have questions, Ned Student30"	10/2/2015 10:43	1441	7	"Feedback is critical, and considers aspects of the current design and poten[firstname]l additions. It references other tools I might be able to use."
Student30	Student53	2	"Hi Team Vocab, This is certainly a worthwhile goal and an intriguing project � I agree with your basic premise that making the app available on mobile devices for free is an important factor, and I like the possible blen[lastname]g of a LENA approach of allowing the recor[lastname]g and playback of conversations with the child with analytics that could provide feedback/helpful training to parents on their conversational/literary strategies, and I like that a good place to start all this is to focus on a vocabulary-buil[lastname]g app. It seems to me the crux of the problem is how best to deliver this training and how best to keep the child involved. Looking closely at LENA might be a good place to start. I wonder too about how well the app might be received and used � and the parent component seems to me to have possibly equal challenges to get parents to use it � moving them along a curve from less involvement/less effective conversational approaches toward more conversation, better vocab and more meaningful interaction with their child seems a big task. Modelling behaviors both for the child and the parent might be the simplest approach, it seems to me. Having a friendly/trusted face to act as a tutor or guide might also encourage attention/participation and quality of outcomes. I have to wonder if some might not use the app precisely because they would not trust that their information would remain private � and that this might be another important factor � and from a usability UI/UX perspective, the easier the better, of course. FWTHIW � one creative approach that occurs to me is a lesson I gained from watching Bugs Bunny cartoons as a kid � and that the cartoons were brilliant because they simultaneously appealed to children and adults � but on a completely different level � this may not be useful for your purposes � but wouldn�t be an interesting approach to somehow put together the child vocab training with the parent conversational training so that they were not handled separately, but at the same time? Just a thought. Hope this helps, and please let me know if you have questions, Ned Student30"	10/2/2015 11:30	36		
Student30	Student63	2	"Hi Yi-Chen, As an undergraduate physics major at UT-Austin and as a part-time tutor of physics to high school and college students for the past 25+ years, this subject is near and dear to my heart. I was not aware of the Andes system and was pleased to check it out, so thank you for putting that on my radar. I agree with the results based on use of the Andes system that students have measurably better outcomes when using the system versus paper-and-pencil. And try to use interactive graphics whenever I am tutoring basic mechanics/kinematics problems. And I often point back to Kahn Academy and YouTube videos for specific illustrative examples. In my experience, physics students learn better if they can �see be picture� and only develop good physics intuition after lots of explanation and practice. Seeing a motion video of an object in motion, with an overlay of the velocity and acceleration vectors, for example, can be a real eye-opener. I like your approach of an independent Bayesian network used to identify problem areas and provide useful hints. In my experience this is very much needed because students have to learn the methodology of solution by being shown, then stepped through the process. It is possible, and desirable, I think, to break kinematics problems for example into a series of steps to be followed in essen[firstname]lly the same order each time. Similarly, for basic 2D problems in statics or with accelerations � on a flat surface, with an inclined plane, with a pulley, one object or two � all can and should be taught in a methodical way that lends itself of your method. I would suggest by way of proof of concept/demo using perhaps one or two examples to start. Also, take a look at these three videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAKbu8KEZck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgy80ce8E3E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-lbINvshtM They represent three different approaches/presentations for the same type of problem � notice that the last one is � I would argue � not so great in the sense that the presenter is a bit of a bore and does not really explain and solve the problem in a clear and compelling way. Even though the sound is poor on the first, the presenter is engaging and lively, and the second one is a great presentation. I understand you are taking a gaming approach, which is great, but the question comes back to clarity and engagement, I think. Your choice of PhET interactive simulations platform is an interesting one and should allow you the flexibility and power you need to rapidly develop, I�m guessing. Good luck with this project as it is a great one� ;) Hope this helps, and please let me know if you have questions, Ned Student30"	10/2/2015 11:55	62		
Student30	Student67	1	"Hi [firstname], I agree with your goal of the development of mobile-based apps that facilitate student motivation as a necessary and critical component of successful learning outcomes. Let me share with you a story from a friend in McKinney, Texas who has taught AP History at the high school level for some 25+ years. Last summer he taught a history summer school course for some 60 students who had failed history during the fall/spring term � and he taught this entirely online through an app that allowed him to create course content (e.g. read this, watch that) and administratively could monitor in real time and with reports when students were online and what they were working on. He felt like his primary tasks were not teaching so much as administratively monitoring the kids � essen[firstname]lly acting as proctor or nanny � he actually spent a fair amount of time calling the kids up in the morning and telling them to get out of bed, logon and get started on their studies � and was surprised that many students were working on coursework after midnight. His graduate rate for this class I think was around 60% - which he considers a win as these were students who had failed before, this was summer school, many/most were pretty turned off toward education in general, and because this was online, there was little incentive to logon and complete the coursework, other than the general incentive to complete the course and graduate. Looking at this from the 10,000 foot level, you have to wonder if the primary motivating factor lea[lastname]g to this success rate was that Richard called them up like a drill sergeant getting them out of bed � and that he could do so based on student progress reports and real-time logon info provided by the app. Hope this helps, and please let me know if you have questions, Ned Student30"	10/2/2015 11:56	1498	7

May be you want to mention that earlier.	10/2/2015 13:31	217	5	"Got it, point taken, [firstname], thank you. An old rhetorical habit to discount myself as an individual in a zen or group sense - focusing on the project and process rather than the individual... ;)"
Student21	Student67	2	Looks good. One recommendation I have is to test users before recommen[lastname]g courses. Some courses are for advanced students and users in beginning level might get discouraged if they are not able to do well in the recommended courses. I like what Khan academy has for testing kids.	10/2/2015 13:36	310	7

And as you discussed there are a lot of variables like age, skills, instructor;s style etc, this will be a lot of work. If there is a way to put some limitations lets say age group limitations etc, that will help. I really like your breakdown of the work!

Student45	Student100	2	"This is definitely the best proposal I have seen in this course. It is organized so well and covers all the aspects one could possibly think of. I love the comparison who did with existing tools and how your tool will be different from those. The things that make them less useful and things which you will in-corporate into your project really help distinguish your idea from the existing solutions. The division of work is awesome, and I loved the gantt chart. I will definitely do this in our team project proposal as well."	10/2/2015 15:18	193		
Student45	Student10	2	"Firstly, I really like the theory behind this tool, these 3 principles are simple and yet very powerful in meaning and even more difficult to implement.

I love the idea of converting in eventually into a browser plugin I like your plans for establishing spaces to make it readable for non-native speakers, and [firstname]ing proper nouns, text colorization, voice recor[lastname]gs, vocab lists etc. These ideas will definitely make learning little less challenging. And finally, I would be very interested in using your tool and see how effective it is in helping me familiarize with Chinese. I visited China two years back and fell sick, it was the worst thing that could happen to a person because i couldn't even get medicine for me.

Student58	Student19	1	"So the general design of the game is as a real-time platformer, but it will incorporate analogies to programming concepts that will introduce the concepts to young learners? Or will the game begin incorporating visual co[lastname]g to complete levels/goals where the moves are ""coded"" and then the character tries to complete the level based on the program developed? The ba[firstname] between fun and education that you mention is a challenge for educational games. I remember using logo in school and loving the problem solving aspect, but there really wasn't much ""game"" there and many others just got bored. Some of that might be solved by having more story/game up front to get the child engaged and then introduce educational concepts a bit further in. You could also have ""game"" segments gated by problem solving. Have a co[lastname]g problem level, then have a platforming level that's just fun and repeat that. You might want to consider who your specific audience is, you mention k - 5 but that might be a fairly large range given the level of development children go through at those ages. Cutting that range in half and targeting one of the groups could produce better results. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out."	10/2/2015 21:46	1473	6	
Student58	Student56	1	"Will your research have a specific demographic focus? I could see a situation where the assessment methods demonstrate different results for people in different age groups for example. Or if the current literature demonstrates that there is a distinction in results by demographic will that just be incorporated into the paper as described. In your timeline you state that the completed question 9 would be publishable as an independent paper. Wouldn't answering question 9 depend heavily on some of the prior answers. I see that you intend to compile the questions into one master paper, but I wonder if it might be more efficient to always view this as one paper focused on answering question 9."	10/2/2015 22:49	650	7	
Student58	Student9	1	"I'm curious why those games were chosen for your analysis if the focus of the project is a game teaching physics. Portal makes a lot of sense to me since its a physics based puzzle game but the others are quite different. Do you feel that a turn based game would be best for teaching physics? Would analyzing more games with a physics component be helpful? You state that you're looking for a design where victory is directly tied to learning, how do you plan on isolating that for the games in question? Portal has puzzles preventing success, so I see the connection between learning and success seems fairly straightforward. Civ5 and Sim City have success metrics that are further removed from learning. While I agree that their structure leads to learning and you need to learn to eventually win, the connection is somewhat more abstract. I haven't gotten around to playing Papers, Please so I can't comment on that. Is there a demographic focus for your prototype? Adult and childhood education might be best served with different mechanics."	10/2/2015 23:02	1024	6	
Student58	Student25	1	"Good breakdown of the project. You might want to include a specific timeline for the project, I think that was part of the requirements and most other projects I've seen include one. Will your analysis include a review of implementation, since most educational set-ups will be [lastname]sitioning from a legacy system?"	10/2/2015 23:35	234		
Student25	Student9	1	"Fascinating rea[lastname]g your proposal on designing a framework for connecting education and games. Love Sim City 2000 growing up and will be interested to see your analysis on all of the games that will help you prototype a game! Perhaps discussing the effects of games in different subjects. For example, is a game more effective for learning Math and Science opposed to Social Sciences or History. Or are there opportunities to use a game or simulation in every subject in some form or fashion. Great work!"	10/2/2015 23:14	822		
Student25	Student13	1	Your project proposal is very detailed and informative! Looks like by analyzing KBAI you will have a good perspective on analyzing student success and performance. I haven't taken KBAI but I have heard nothing but good things about it and certainly has peeked my interest! I think key data will be the learner attributes and seeing how that impacts their engagement with the class and success. Good luck guys!	10/2/2015 23:28	734	7	Thanks! I want the learner attributes as well and will be looking / hoping that we can get that!
Student25	Student35	2	"Hey [firstname], Again, you have gone above and beyond on the overall layout and design of your project! Glad to see you incorporate a section on ""gaming"" the system or student manipulation. I can't really think of any other feedback to give. Great work and good luck!"	10/2/2015 23:40	609		
Student25	Student72	1	"Great job on laying out your goals for the paper and project! Not knowing anything about montessori schools, I have learned a lot more about the approach to education. With internet connections usually lousy in K-12 environments, preparing technology for an ""offline"" experience becomes important. Your table hits on a major problem I see commonly is just the lack of technical support. Teachers get paid to teach not troubleshoot technology problems but when the teacher has very little support it makes a huge barrier to overcome when trying to implement technology in the classroom. Good luck with the rest of the project!"	10/2/2015 23:51	1149	4	
Student74	Student96	1	"I had the opportunity to read Situated Learning over the summer. It is a great read! It seems like you have a good idea on the need, though as you mentioned, it can bank on the fact that it requires mass adoption in an environment that might not provide it. The weekly schedule looks definitely doable, though it seems like you have a lot of work ahead of you! Great proposal. Best wishes!"	10/2/2015 23:51	323	6	
Student74	Misc3	2	"Very complete proposal! I imagine you've gotten the same from your mentor, but I cannot see anything that needs to be [lastname]ed or improved for tho=is week's assignment. I saw you devoted plenty of time for testing (which is great!) but in a short term project like this, it might pay off to use a bi of that testing time to develop unit tests early on. Especially in a system that might need multiple tweaks as new input data is given, the advantage of being able to quickly make sure none of the [lastname]es breaks anything previously working is important! Of course, an interesting challenge is always provided by having to unit test anything that has a random component to it. Great work, best of luck!"	10/2/2015 23:57	526		
Student74	Student41	1	"Interesting concept. It still needs a bit of refinement on the specific tasks. If you are to develop an app for the SMEs on top of the Storyline add-on, it may be a fairly involved project for a single person in two months! I have personally used Twilio, mogreet and Nexmo at work. They are all very similar and work really well (twilio is probably y favorite). The costs of a popular solution can grow relatively quick, though! Lastly, a big problem to address (and something I have experienced as a TA) is consistency. In the class I am TAing here's 7 of us TAs, and it takes weekly meeting and emails to make sure our answers on the forums are consistent in terms of quality and narrative. Even then, every now and then we end up giving conflicting answers. It would be interesting to see how the development of the environment for the SMEs to train and collaborate would go. Great project, good luck!"	10/3/2015 10:45	12		
Student74	Student6	1	"It sounds like a great idea. Sadly, without having any knowledge on what is involved in adapting or modifying SIMAC, it is a bit difficult to give specific feedback, so this might sound a bit gen[firstname]. Working with other person's code can be a bit daunting at times. I'd recommend to spend a little extra time documenting anything you build and any understan[lastname]g you gain about the current system. It will pay off when coming back to review the code, or a new version of the software comes out and you need to modify your current solution to work with it. I always budget some time in for that kind of activity. Regar[lastname]g the coming back to review: especially when you are working with code that will need to be validated by other people, you may need to go in a loop of quick reviews and [lastname]es. It seems you have accounted for plenty of time for testing and validation in terms of percentage of the semester devoted to it, but I would recommend developing unit tests as much as possible to reduce the possibility of any minor [lastname]es on one end to negatively impact other parts of your project that may already be working great. Great proposal, good luck!"	10/3/2015 10:45	515	4	
Student91	Student90	2	"Hello [firstname], I think your project is very interesting, shows lost of information about the problem, so I understand you are very informed about this problem. You have also organized very well your analysis and understan[lastname]g to be applied to the project. I hope this software can reflect well the fundamentals in which is being designed. Good luck, and keep up the good work."	10/3/2015 2:24	21	4	
Student91	Student67	1	"Hello [firstname], I like very much that you chose to work on the motivational part of taking MOOCs. It is matter of doing the first step, evaluating it and going forward from then. I wish you the best with your project. I will also would like to share my proposal to You and others in the class, may be [firstname] will do that after the final.proposal."	10/3/2015 16:19	14	6	
Student91	Student30	1	"Hello Ned, I agree in the importance of this kind of comprehensive view of the What and Who of the Education and Technology intersection, inclu[lastname]g the how and why and beyond, It may just become a very important resource for great insights. Given the wide scope that this work can get, and not knowing more information about your project as you do , is difficult for me to see how manageable it could be in one semester. I truly would like that you manage to get at the end a comprehensible and insightful ini[firstname]l resource for the purposes described."	10/3/2015 20:12	14	6	"Hi [firstname], Thank you - wish me luck!"
Student91	Student21	2	"Hello, I also realize the special challenge that there is in this project that should serve as the most comfortable and accurate source of information for and from several thousands of OMS students. It has to be really scalable, and has to work well. But fortunately we all in this course are starting the development of our ideas in a comfortable and orderly way, and my impression is that everything is flowing well. Your project is a very interesting one to me, also because of the development process point of view and the scalability factor. I still have to learn modern ways of development and practice more with modern technologies like cloud development, that I would like to follow closely it to learn from it. I look forward to see your final paper and presentation. Good luck."	10/4/2015 5:47	1500		
Student75	Student87	1	What kind of parser that you are going to use? Are you going to use any optimization tool after parsing the data? Thanks!	10/3/2015 11:05	242		
Student75	Student52	1	"I was expecting the estimated hours for each task and deliverable. Anyway, thanks!"	10/3/2015 11:09	182	6	
Student75	Student4	1	"The list of deliverable are nice described but it would be great if you can add the estimated hours for the deliverable (max around 100 hours for all) and break down the task with priority. Anyway, thanks!"	10/3/2015 11:12	175		
Student75	Student61	1	"The list of deliverable are nicely described but it would be great if you can add the estimated hours for the deliverable (max around 100 hours for all) and break down the task with priority. Anyway, thanks!"	10/3/2015 11:15	91	6	Added details to list of deliverables. Fining that one of the large risks in that it could get out of hand if I dont track it carefully.
Student99	Student66	1	"Hi [firstname], Sounds like an ambitious project for the rest of the semester--only feedback I have: would be helpful to describe some of the similar games in this field and some research (citations) to back your claims about this gap in computer programming games. Overall, seems like a cool project. Thanks!"	10/3/2015 11:42	680		
Student99	Student64	1	"Hi [firstname], Looks great. Part of your stated proposal is looking at how to bridge the tech gap for lower income communities. Besides the qualitative/quantitative measurements, have you found any numbers on higher-income communities and how edTech affects them (differences between effect on higher-income vs lower-income)? I realize some of that may be confounded by the fact that higher-income communities already have the edTech. Anyways, good luck with your research! Thanks!"	10/3/2015 11:54	392	6	Gave good advice to areas we can research to add to our project.
Student99	Student12	1	Great proposal and idea--any plans to do usability testing? Probably worthwhile to get early feedback from OMSCS students and prospective students. Thanks!	10/3/2015 12:00	4024		
Student99	Student83	2	"Hi Mike, I really like this idea--anecdotally, when tutoring students in math, the real difference in students is not those who get it right away vs. those who don't. The real difference is those who get stuck and give up vs. those who get stuck and start applying diagnostic/problem-solving skills--this is true in the workplace as well: those who can work independently to learn vs. those who need their hands held at each point. This does not mean that asking for help is not important (knowing when to ask for help is critical)--this idea of working through a difficult problem instead of just being stuck is not a character flaw, but (as you imply) a set of tools that can be taught, the earlier the better. I think it's a great idea. Not directly pertinent to this project perhaps, but to whom would you [firstname]et this tool (schools? kids? adults? anyone?)? How would you garner interest in using this tool? Thanks!"	10/3/2015 14:03	8	7	
Student12	Student96	2	I love this idea-especially as a web developer. I see huge poten[firstname]l for this and can't wait to see the finished product. Good luck!!!	10/3/2015 12:51	339	6	
Student12	Student15	0	I can't give adequate feedback because I don't fully understand the overall scope of your project. But I wish you lots of luck!!	10/3/2015 13:00	172		
Student12	Student83	2	This is a great idea. I can't wait to see the finished product. Good luck!	10/3/2015 13:03	1492		
Student12	Student74	2	I love the idea of Video Modeling and using it to aid children with autism. One note is I think that the app needs to remain intuitive and easy to learn. Great Job!!!	10/3/2015 13:28	211		
Student47	Student21	1	"This is a much needed tool and would contribute tremendously to the OMSCS program. Great job on the proposal and I thought it was very helpful to see your API docs. You mentioned about heroku and its limitation on the free plan. Github offers students some free services inclu[lastname]g DNS and cloud hosting. Not sure if any of this will be helpful, but feel free to check it out https://education.github.com/pack, unfortunately heroku isn't on their, but digital ocean is. I noticed you didn't have any information about how you intend on managing this project successfully. What PM tool will be used to keep track of status and tasks? What issue tracking system will you use to keep track of QA tasks and bugs? Do you already have browser requirements defined? Will you be testing and getting feedback on the application from users outside your team, inclu[lastname]g current and prospective students? Would this help or hurt your process? I think it would be hard to do a significant focus/beta group in the limited amount of time, so that might be something to discuss with your mentor. Good luck!"	10/3/2015 13:18	1468		
Student47	Student33	1	"Very thorough qualitative data that you will be gathering, you've touched on all the statekholders. I think making sure you ask the right questions will be key. Great job on getting all those interviews lined up. Will you be doing these interviews in person, via online conference, or just email back and forth? Regar[lastname]g scratch and tinker, I'm not familiar with the two. What are the differences? What makes one platform better than another? Are you proposing that student's should use one of these, or both of these, or one or the other? Will the tool you use affect learning and engagement? In other words, I'd like to hear more about why you chose these two in particular. Great proposal though and look forward to seeing your results. I think you are just missing your weekly milestones for the final proposal. Also, do you need IRB?"	10/3/2015 13:42	723	7	
Student47	Student91	1	"Very interesting AI agent topic and I'd like to see where you end up going with this. It's very nostalgic and now I miss KBAI haha. Good luck with the project. Whenever I am taking notes as I am watching a lecture, I think the most challenging part is that I have to pause the video take down the notes and then continue. All of these pauses are distracting. I don't know if it is better to watch the entire lecture, and then rewatch it a second time at which point then I take my notes. Additionally, if I am taking screenshots, unless I have two monitors again I have to pause and move the lecture video out of the way. So I know a lot of the OMSCS courses do not have the option to download the video captions. And the video captions on the videos are typically incorrect. Do you think it should be a requirement for professors to upload/fix the captions? With that in place, I think it would make your tool much more usable for the user. They can go through the prompts and highlight areas of the text. Something more embedded like that would be best. Or maybe its not, since having the student have to think about the classification and type out different text notes themselves might make them remember the concepts better."	10/3/2015 13:54	1606	7	He made good comments on different details of the student interaction with my project application.
Student47	Student90	1	"You have a very good grasp of the literature and research on DD. I think you are on the right track and clearly laid out what success looks like each week. I would recommend fin[lastname]g forums where people that struggle with dyscalculia frequent. Run your proposal by them, get some more feedback and show them your prototype when you get to that point. Interestingly, I tried to do a ini[firstname]l search and placyes like dystalk or dyscalculiaforums.com were either not updated or down. Why do you think online resources for people struggling or fin[lastname]g information about dyscalculia are so limited or out of date? Do you think that will make it more challenging for you to complete your project on time and successfully?"	10/3/2015 14:30	809	7	those are very good suggestions.
Student97	Student7	1	"Very good proposal with detailed deliverables on timeline. Please include me as your alpha and beta tester, i would love to try your project, email me at: Student97."	10/3/2015 13:13	2226		
Student97	Student43	1	Very interesting project proposal. I agree that provi[lastname]g 3D environment as real as possible will make them learn better. I know nothing about unity but I know those games have very realistic graphics. Do you plan make your tool available also for PC without 3D graphic card?	10/3/2015 13:50	830	5	
Student97	Student40	1	"Very good project proposal, you have detailed your requirements and give enough information for checking your progress each week. Are you going to integrate attendance with work day for payroll purpose? I think that should be a good gimmick to ""forced"" everyone to use your application."	10/3/2015 14:04	868		
Student97	Student8	1	"Very interesting project proposal, backed with solid theory your project will be greatly useful for helping students with Autism."	10/3/2015 14:18	1091		
Student90	Student80	0	I think game theory applied to freeloa[lastname]g is very interesting. It would have been useful to read your past assignments to understand this proposal a little bit better. I'm looking forward to rea[lastname]g your final product.	10/3/2015 14:39	356	4	"It's good to know that I need to work explanation a bit, but I need to know what to cut more than what to add. Not unhelpful, but not particularly helpful either."
Student90	Student67	1	I would have like to see more research on the subject to make the app more valid.	10/3/2015 23:17	14	5	
Student90	Student30	2	There is nothing wrong with aiming high. The issue is that the time required to produce a complete study may be more than that available for this class. Maybe narrowing down to research in a particular aspect of ed tech may help you meet our final deadline.	10/3/2015 23:18	437	5	"Hi [firstname], I understand the challenge and you are right on the money to point this out. I will all depend, I think, on how I approach the problem - at this point I remain sufficiently interested in the topic to dedicate more time to get this sufficiently build out - time will tell... ;)"
Student90	Student21	1	"The first issue I have with this paper is its use of typography. A sans serif font is difficult to read when the lines are so close to each other. Second, it would have been interesting to understand the goals in more detail. Perhaps this was done in previous submissions."	10/4/2015 0:08	35		
Student86	Student44	1	Great research topic to help reducing the college dropout and failure rate. I really liked the outline of the tasks that you have presented to complete the research. This is a good list. The only feedback I have for you is to drill down into the core part of the research ( other than writing the documents) and show a detailed list of tasks that includes the data research and data collection.	10/3/2015 15:49	510		
Student86	Student76	2	This is a great research topic on ATS affective tutoring system. I really like the entire proposal and It looks really good. I went thru the entire document and you have done it excellently. I do not have any points that could improve the proposal as it really looks good now. Great Job!	10/3/2015 15:57	215		
Student86	Student2	1	This is a great research and app concept idea in the EdTech area. Your draft proposal looks really good. The task list looks good but the only feedback that I have is to include the high level features of the app in the task list. You do not have to drill down too much but the high level feature list on the task list will help the proposal.	10/3/2015 16:01	264		
Student86	Student32	2	"wow, great proposal document and all sections look great. There is really nothing to improve. It is very clear and includes all the details needed. Good luck."	10/3/2015 16:05	90		
Student84	Student11	1	I think this is pretty clear. I remember seeing your previous writeups. You guys have plenty of work laid out in your timeline. Good luck.	10/3/2015 15:58	127		
Student84	Student86	2	well done. I think this is past being a draft and its ready as final proposal. good luck	10/3/2015 16:00	80		
Student84	Student76	2	very well thought out. I have nothing to add. This is very well structured and done well. Good luck	10/3/2015 16:01	54		
Student84	Student2	1	Looks good. I think Meteor is a good idea. I've only seen instructional videos on it but it seems pretty powerful and can help you deliver a product pretty quickly. Good luck.	10/3/2015 16:02	127		
Student15	Misc3	2	"you did well to document in detail, this is a draft proposal, but still had tons of details, good luck."	10/3/2015 18:06	67		
Student15	Student74	1	"Very interesting learning model, well done on the details. Good luck."	10/3/2015 18:08	95		
Student15	Student96	1	"Nice schedule, it wasn't clear what is the final goal of this project. Good luck"	10/3/2015 18:09	79	6	
Student15	Student41	1	"Good luck, it would be helpful if you state how your system will create advantages."	10/3/2015 18:11	51		
Student70	Student18	1	"Hello [firstname], It is a very interesting project giving importance to emotions in an online setting. I find it a very compelling way to give students a chance to demonstrate their feelings towards the learning experience, as well as a way for the professor to gauge his/her teaching methods and the students reactions. I see a couple of opportunities. First, just like with any survey, how can we make sure that students are respon[lastname]g with the truth and not based on what they think the professor wants to know. Secondly, this method needs to assure the student that there will be no reGuest4tion for showing their true emotions about the learning experience. It would be helpful to have a high level description of the tasks you need to take on to accomplish this project in the given amount of time. It is an ambitious project that can be finished by following a detailed timeline."	10/3/2015 18:58	1475		
Student70	Student77	1	"Hello [firstname], I really like your project idea, in fact it will be very useful to have such an app. If I understand correctly you as student can rate the resource (paper, publication, link, etc) so then later on you can come back to it, but what about keeping record of that feedback to put on top the resource that has been more helpful for most students in the class? The only problem with this approach is that you should have a centralized DB which keeps all the data. I think your proposal is concise which is very good! Also I have shared links to papers on Piazza and the feedback was good but my impression is that only 3 or 4 students saw it. Looking forward to using this app!"	10/3/2015 19:11	1074		
Student70	Student1	1	"Hello Sam, I think your proposal is very interesting and the problem you are trying to solve is becoming more common as online courses' popularity increase. Perhaps the time that people spend logged on the ILMS should not be one of the key elements. Quality of work should be more important than time spent on the site. A recommendation is to study if there is a correlation between the time spent on the site vs. work quality. I think one of the advantages of online classes is their flexibility and the opportunity to work on ones own time. Task list and Calendar are very helpful."	10/3/2015 19:23	2577	7	
Student70	Student26	2	"Team Auger, I really like your proposal, it is very well structured and easy to understand as well. Here are a couple of thoughts: - when talking about automatic gra[lastname]g how do you envision to detect the same work/project sent by two students? - it should be very convenient to create an architecture that allows external people to use their own gra[lastname]g algorithms, in case they want to grade some alternative languages. It is a challenging project but I think you should be able to accomplish it. Good luck!"	10/3/2015 19:33	2843		
Student36	Student86	1	"Great team breakdown. I don't see much about meetings to discuss work updates, I recommend you include time to be spent on group update meetings."	10/3/2015 21:03	73		
Student36	Student16	0	This was very short for a project proposal. I recommend reviewing the rubric and expan[lastname]g on your sections. Update the formatting a bit to look like a professional proposal. The rest is fine!	10/3/2015 21:04	46	4	
Student36	Student84	1	"As [firstname] said, be careful with your datasets and data collection. Try and work with real trends isolating as many variables as possible when doing analysis. I also think this proposal needs more information on the problem/solution. It looks like most time was spent on the schedule."	10/3/2015 21:05	93	3	Rushed invalid comments.
Student36	Student11	2	Best formatting I've seen on these papers. I would try to keep your results focused so that you don't generate too large of a scope as the project goes on.	10/3/2015 21:06	45		
Student50	Student25	1	"Hey, [firstname]! This sounds it'll make for a great exploration. A couple quick notes came to mind as I read over your first draft, so I've included them below: - It might be helpful to end the introduction with a clear statement connecting the situation you've described to the work you're doing. It may seem redundant, but stepping the reader through the entire flow of [current state => problem => solution] makes for a strong opening. - There's one small typo in your introduction. You write that, ""Educators and students both benefit of virtualized environments to access ..."" Consider replacing the ""of"" with a ""from"" instead. - Splitting your time between those four technologies seems appropriate, but consider ad[lastname]g a bit more fine-grained detail about where time will be spent on each. What would your weekly check-ins look like, for example? In any case, great stuff! This sounds like it'll be a helpful investigation that might create some leverage to better equip schools with more updated technology. Good luck as you start out!"	10/3/2015 21:21	621		
Student50	Student58	2	"Wow - rea[lastname]g this proposal makes me wish *I* was doing this research. This is fantastic, and something in which I'm very interested. I ended up narrowing my own scope to a subset of this (predictive factors for attrition), but I'm excited about your work - it's bound to be wonderful, insightful analysis! It seems you've got all the bases covered on the proposal front, and there's really little room for improvement. There may be a couple of ways to structure this more formally, but I don't think that's strictly necessary in this context; this is a great, comprehensive roadmap of your project. I can't wait to see how it works out! Great job! (On a related sidenote - as ludicrous as it sounds, if you need another set of hands, you wouldn't have to ask me twice. There's significant overlap in intent here, and I'd be thrilled at the opportunity to work towards some of the goals I set aside due to lack of manpower/hours. At very least, I anticipate we'll be sen[lastname]g out very similar surveys. :) Seriously, let me know of you've any interest in collaborating!) In any case - best of luck as you continue your research! This proposal is spectacular!"	10/3/2015 21:31	2808		
Student50	Student56	1	"Sounds like a great lit review! I'm particularly intrigued by proposed exploration part 2 - ""how various departments of education...might find meaning and patterns within that data."" Your choice of narrowed scope sounds like a great subset of that to tackle this term, and the weekly breakdown of topics sounds well-ba[firstname]d. I imagine each will make a great stand-alone dissection. Good luck!"	10/3/2015 22:18	8334		
Student50	Student19	1	"Wonderful project - this sounds great! I'd love to hear more about the core mechanics you'll be leveraging to teach concepts. Will this game focus more on explicitly or implicitly teaching programming skills? In any case, this proposal seems to cover all the key aspects well, and your schedule seems reasonable. I almost wonder if it'd be helpful to take on some of your deployment tasks earlier; having a working framework can be useful in continuous development. How better to test out your designs than with a working build? I can't wait to see the final product - best of luck!"	10/4/2015 0:37	3683	6	
Student98	Student17	1	"This was a good start for the first draft. The schedule could have provided more details. For example, set up test cases and delegate different people to test the tool. Great job on showing the layout of the tool. Should provide more detail for the final proposal."	10/3/2015 21:34	315		
Student98	Student36	1	"This was a good start for the first draft. The schedule could have provided more details. For example, the breakdown of the code to be developed each week. Want to also see a layout of the format of the tool. Should provide more detail for the final proposal. Good start."	10/3/2015 21:39	128	5	
Student98	Student16	0	This was on the same level as the paper I turned in so I am able to judge your paper the way my peers have judged mine. This was a good start for the first draft but it requires more details. I redid my first draft to look like the ones the teacher posted on Piazza. Take a look at the ones the TA and teacher liked. Be sure to provide more details for the final proposal.	10/3/2015 21:42	235	4	
Student98	Student84	0	This paper was on the same level as the paper I submitted for the first draft. The schedule looks good but overall the paper requires more details. Take a look at the first drafts on Piazza that the professor liked and model your submission around the best one. The paper will need a lot more details provided for the final proposal. Good luck. Be sure to include a picture of the format or layout for your topic.	10/3/2015 21:46	211	2	Useless and rushed feedback
Student34	Student64	1	"I'm really impressed by the line-up of interviews you have planned. I don't think I'm quite grasping the details of what you're planning to test out with the kids and how, and I would have liked to see that be fleshed out a little more."	10/3/2015 23:04	215		
Student34	Student51	1	"I think the survey of existing work in the area would make a lot of sense as an appendix, since it's certainly valuable but it's not the core of what your proposal is focused on achieving. Breaking up some of the longer paragraphs and ad[lastname]g a little more white space between paragraphs would boost readability. I like that you try to establish what video modeling is with respect to athletes, but I think it would have been easier to follow some of the earlier parts talking about therapy if the switch to discussing what video modeling means in the context of children who are in need of therapy."	10/3/2015 23:08	1571		
Student34	Student99	1	"I think the section on existing solutions could use some extra attention here. Coursera uses typing patterns as a biometric identifier for the person who's turning something in, but it doesn't necessarily validate that the work belongs to the person who's turning it in in every place it's used. I don't think it's quite clear whether your intention for ghost-written is just written by someone else (and perhaps taken without permission) or written for the person turning it in as a service. The latter is significantly harder to detect, since something done 'honestly' in that sense will be unique and won't set off any alarm bells for duplication, but there should still be differences in writing style between the ghost author and the student author. (This doesn't work out if you never have a known-good sample from the student. They could conceivably have everything written by the ghost author.)"	10/3/2015 23:34	684		
Student34	Student66	1	"I'm not quite grasping why showing that typing is a crucial skill for programming is a goal, unless you just mean that you want to [lastname]force the value of typing as a skill. I'm also not quite sure that I would agree that when a high school is teaching programming in an industry-focused way, they're necessarily teaching 'true computer science', but that's a little off the topic here. For the actual tool, I think Scratch is open source. I realize you're putting the drag and drop interface aside for now, but Scratch does a drag-and-drop so you might want to think about how you could eventually hook in with something like that."	10/3/2015 23:46	480	2	Clearly rushed feedback due to proximity of peer feedback deadline
Student56	Student13	1	"This is an excellent, superbly organized proposal. I took KBAI this past summer. I wonder if you're planning to survey past students as part of your research? If yes, I'd be happy to participate. Good luck!"	10/4/2015 0:08	141	7	Excellent to get such positive feedback!
Student56	Student19	1	"This is an excellent project. It's interesting to think about teaching programming to kids, as I first encountered programming in college. I'd like to play your game, as well! Good luck!"	10/4/2015 0:11	121	5	
Student56	Student25	1	"Interesting topic, and organized proposal presentation. Good luck!"	10/4/2015 0:13	58		
Student56	Student9	1	"Great project topic! I'm also touching on your topic in my project, and this is a title I ordered that may be helpful to you as well: http://www.amazon.com/Psychometric-Considerations-Game-based-Assessment-Mislevy/dp/1495440834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443932118&sr=8-1&keywords=game+based+psychometrics"	10/4/2015 0:14	116		
Student87	Student78	1	"You're idea seems like it will take quite a bit of time to come up with a fully fledged model that can interact with the student. Also, it seems like you have chosen the C# domain because you really know what you're doing and are comfortable working in that environment. One question I have is that a primary method for this system is recognizing sensory output from the user and recognizing queues from the user that trigger various forms of learning from the tutoring system. If you were implementing a real system, what kind of visual or auditory queues would you look for?"	10/4/2015 1:00	384		
Student87	Student71	1	"This is a very interesting topic. I see a lot of poten[firstname]l for applications of this technology to the various learning situations. I think this comes from the fact that this technology is so adaptive. A parent, doctor, or whoever can customize the videos for individual users and receive feedback to learn the learner's learning style. I'm really interested to see what you guys come up with. You guys also did a very good job of searching for the competitors and analyzing what each one of them went did right or wrong."	10/4/2015 1:07	500	4	
Student87	Student59	1	"I will hand it to you: You're very brave to try to take on a natural language project. I also agree that Python is probably the best language given that speed is not an immediate concern and you really don't need any advanced parallelization here that other languages would offer. A few suggestions: You may want to devote a bit more time to searching for databases of books. The reason why is because databases with good information are fairly scarce (I used to be a data scientist; and fin[lastname]g good public datasets was difficult) and especially given that you may have trouble fin[lastname]g out what books that are returned by the classifier are really good and which ones are really bad. I also think that instead of trying to develop a classifier on your own (this typically takes a lot longer than the entire 100 hours we basically have for the project :)), you may want to think about using one in sci kit learn and one that it already established (This may have been what you meant; but I just don't want you to overextend yourself). Overall, I look forward to seeing what you create. Great job."	10/4/2015 1:15	482	6	Good insight into something I am realizing myself as I actually get underway with this project.
Student87	Student5	1	"As someone who is also making a tool for the OMSCS program, I think that you guys have a very viable product that can be used to really help students. I think my recommendation engine and your product would go hand and hand in helping students see if their ready for classes. I think that many of the products being created for this program may (in the future) end up being merged into one viable product. I think your idea would be the main application; with products like mine as add-ons. I look forward to seeing how everything goes."	10/4/2015 1:23	439		
Student49	Student22	1	I think what you are aiming to accomplish is great. They conveyance of computer science knowledge is also an area my team is exploring. I f you get a chance you might want to look into how to engage your audience and keep them interested. My personal question revolved around extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and how they plan into engaging various learners. Perhaps this is an area you could also look into. Look forward to hearing more about your research.	10/4/2015 1:24	503		
Student49	Student42	1	"Your idea is excellent, ui/ux design is a very important aspect and lends itself greatly to the conveyance of knowledge to your adolescent target audience. One thing I have been researching is how to engage an audience, looking at the benefits and disadvantages and when to promote extrinsic and intrinsic motivation has helped me greatly in this respect, perhaps taking a look into these and how they play into engaging varying audiences will help you. Good luck!"	10/4/2015 1:33	283		
Student49	Student88	1	"Great idea, and I hope your research bares fruit to help course along in the future! One thing you may be able to expand upon is the schedule. You may want to look into having a more detailed schedule, other than that everything looks good, good luck!"	10/4/2015 1:37	227		
Student49	Student45	1	"Excellent idea, and great layout of design. I like to consider myself a bit of an angular expert and would have like to see some architecture design, but perhaps that will come later. I like how you laid out you requests and routes. In our application we had a diagram explaining the architecture, SPA, with the breakdown of par[firstname]ls, controllers, routes, factories, services, containers, etc. You may want to look into getting down to that amount of detail. Look forward to seeing the end product!"	10/4/2015 1:41	326	5	
Student2	Student24	2	"Wow, fantastic proposal, [firstname]! Extremely complete from both pedagogical and technical perspectives. I'll start by saying I like your project idea. I think it would be a boon to have a similar, polished tool available in the OMSCS and elsewhere. One thing I'm not clear on still -- and perhaps it's the fault of my own rea[lastname]g comprehension -- but to what extent exactly is the process automated? You stated: ""These challenges necessitate a need for some kind of automated tool which will assists both Instructors and Students to achieve right ba[firstname] in the group work and be conducive to more meaningful projects."" I think you're collecting enough information to fully automate team formation, but rea[lastname]g the proposal leads me to believe you're leaning towards provi[lastname]g automated insights/suggestions instead. For what it's worth, I think that'd be a far more effective approach. I'd personally be more interested in a tool which intelligently aids in group formation, rather than throwing students into buckets. My guess is instructors share the same preference. Going forward, I'd say to carefully consider the [firstname]ghting of various factors (particularly things like technical skills) in your algorithms. Make sure you're designing a tool that not only works well, but that students and instructors will be happy using. Good luck! [firstname] Student2"	10/4/2015 1:43	864	7	"Thanks [firstname], The automation part of the tool comes into play by proposing grouping of students into different team buckets based on some criteria defined by the Instructors. The criteria to run one of the supported algorithm in the tool maybe in the form of prioritized set of key attributes like skills, availability schedule, etc. (as displayed in Fig 2 and 3) OR a personality based survey questionnaire like Myers-Briggs personality types. Ideally the Instructor/TA staff has to review 200+ students introductory statements and make those decisions to form groups. The tool will facilitate them to choose the option for team formation criteria and run the algorithm to generate a list of probable candidates for individual teams. They can reject the teams proposed by tool and alter the priority fo key attributes to rerun the algorithm until they are satisfied with the teams. Once approved the students will be notified about their team members and the information will be managed through the tool for any [lastname]es/updates. Designing and Implementing different flavors (converging/diverging skills, team compatibility based on personality survey) of algorithm is the key to the success of tool. I appreciate your feedback. Thanks"
Student2	Student32	1	"Excellent work. I've had members from this group seemingly most weeks in Peer Feedback, so what I have left to write is somewhat limited! It is interesting to see the proposal come to a level of technical fruition, and I'm glad the team has a diverse skill set to support the project. And, let me comment on what an incredible boon it is to have such access to an actual classroom environment! I am curious to what extent student performance data will be processed. Are you going to make any intelligent suggestions based on data from students? I think that'd be a really cool aspect of the tool if it were included. Further, how is the data going to be visualized to be useful to instructors? You've got a fantastic definition here, but make sure to really nail the core of the project -- helping instructors provide more useful and targeted teaching material. [firstname] Student2"	10/4/2015 1:57	825		
Student2	Student95	1	"[firstname], Awesome to read how close this project will be to your real world. Certainly among the worthiest projects I've reviewed! One of the main motivations for the project is the prohibitive cost of alternatives. Exactly how expensive are they? How much money are you saving per robot versus equipment which provides comparable educational capability? Which leads me to comment, you're in a really cool position where you understand the impact of various features on the robot. If I were you, I'd suggest not being afraid to tip $50 if necessary if you're getting a large bang for your buck from an educational perspective. For instance, you can probably recognize if a $10 part will open up a month of awesome learning material, versus $50 on something else not being too expensive. Can't wait to see your project! [firstname] Student2"	10/4/2015 2:11	310		
Student2	Student44	1	"[firstname], Good starting point. I apologize I'm so late in the week on this, as I'm sure you've [lastname]ed what you've submitted here appreciably (and likely already submitted your proposal). To that effect, I don't have too much to say with regard to your document. As for your project, it seems like you're well off from an ini[firstname]l research perspective. I'll comment that I, as an arm-chair scientific paper reader, am naturally dubious when I read papers with similar subjects that don't present relevant data to confirm fin[lastname]gs. If possible, I'd strongly encourage some work on your part in analyzing available data sets (a massive, recent set was linked on Piazza recently). Or, it'd also work to find a diverse array of existing data to motivate your novel points. Best, [firstname] Student2"	10/4/2015 2:17	287		
Student48	Student52	1	"Great research project proposal. You did a great job diving into the details about why you were making a [lastname]sition in topic, and why emotional detecting agents could be very helpful in intelligent tutorials. I'm not sure how much information is public, but [firstname]eting and advertisements research would also have a vested interest of designing/developing agents which could detect the emotional state of subjects. You might find some useful information from there also."	10/4/2015 3:05	581	7	
Student48	Student56	0	"Overall good research project proposal. I think it is a very interesting idea, and I'm curious to see what you are able to glean from the existing research. It would be helpful to include where and how the research project will source the data, and account for data contradictions between existing research articles. Also it might be interesting to consider, not all students play video games, what impact would you see if students that were not familiar with how to play video games were required to take their tests that way."	10/4/2015 3:15	327		
Student48	Student92	1	"Overall good design/build project proposal. I think it will be very interesting to design an application to answer this problem, especially since it is so common. It would be interesting to include information about how the tutorial agent/application would be design. Specifically its components, and a rough idea how the student would interact with the tutorial. Minor nit, first bullet point in Summary of Application should be, ""Teachers teach students in chunks"", or this phrase was hard to understand."	10/4/2015 3:20	521		
Student48	Student68	1	"This looks like a very exciting research project proposal. It will be interesting to see the results of the research project. The idea of balancing, and handling for, the situation where scheduled teaching sessions are unable to be completed is very good. In addition to this you provided an exceptionally, and so far the most, detailed breakdown of tasks and summary of those task I've see from a project proposal yet."	10/4/2015 3:29	517		
Student65	Student66	1	"This sounds like an interesting project. I totally agree with you that gamifying programming sets students up for surprise. We don't teach kids to read Shakespeare before they learn to fully grasp grammar, so why teach them graphical based programming before learning the buil[lastname]g blocks? The one thing I didn't get from your proposal was how you intend to implement the feedback and running of the code from students inside the tool itself."	10/4/2015 2:59	1102		
Student65	Student34	2	"This sounds like a good experiment. I haven't taken this course yet, but I am planning on it. The one question I have is how students can give feedback on something mathematical related without knowing the answers. Or will the solutions be provided to them first? I agree with what you said about it not being a controlled experiment in that students who don't need EC might not participate. I think gathering background data on students is a good idea and could serve more purposes than just your project too. This data can be looked at to get a feel for where the students in the course fall with respect to prereqs too, which would just be interesting to evaluate. Since this course is in my future, I look forward to seeing your results."	10/4/2015 3:18	1078	6	Clearly paid attention :)
Student65	Student51	2	"This was very detailed and exceeded expectations, so I don't know what much I can add. I was not aware of the concept of video modeling for students for social skills. I am wondering about the [lastname]sference issue though, and curious how this turns out."	10/4/2015 3:36	736		
Student65	Student99	1	"As an educator, I deal with cheating and academic dishonesty regularly (unfortunate truth). This ranges from all-out cheating by copying someone else's work to students from one year passing along their work to the students who take the course in later years. The only question I have for you is how you might work with simpler projects from early in an intro course where the work is so simple, and as a result authentic submissions might get false positives since there is very little possible variation in the solution."	10/4/2015 3:48	598		
Student4	Student61	1	Interesting project. I am doing a similar project which attempts to enhance problem solving skills in students by following unique approachs and how languages can help in that process. Would be exciting to see your project in action	10/11/2015 1:39	4037		
Student4	Student52	2	Well though out and researched idea. Proposed solution can truly realize the goal of large scale individualized learning	10/11/2015 2:46	2255	7	
Student4	Student87	1	I would love to use this solution to select courses. Eagerly anticipating its release	10/11/2015 3:24	216
