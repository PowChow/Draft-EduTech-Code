Student65	Student24	2	This seems like a very useful and promising tool. Your level of detail shows that you are ready to hit the ground running with this. I was wondering if this in an individual project or a group project? I'm looking forward to seeing how your project goes because this would also be something useful to me as a high school teacher.	9/6/2015 12:23	1142		
Student65	Student48	1	"This sounds like a large research project, and it will be interesting to see your results. I'd be curious how this might fit in to a given school's culture, and if this type of model is well received by students. The long term outcome would be interesting as well."	9/6/2015 12:42	1103	6	
Student65	Student80	1	"This is very interesting. I was wondering if this was an individual or a group project. The only concern I had was that the types of problems you will be looking at for cooperative simulation, such as the prisoner's game, are ""fun"", and you might end up getting more participation and enthusiasm from students who would actually end up being freeloaders if the work was real. I might suggest using actual projects to more accurately model a real group scenario. I would also think that results might be different if a class is small and the students more or less know each other vs. a class that is large and students may be in groups with other students they've never interacted with before. These types of things do alter outcome in a classroom environment."	9/6/2015 13:00	892	6	"Useful although limited feedback. I'm intrigued by the thought of altruistic freeloaders. Some people play for fun. Some people play to help. That may indicate good things for the experiment, rather than bad. Yes, project feedback would be a good measure of project participation, but I would like to develop a predictor, because once the feedback is in, it's too late for that project. Maybe I was unclear in my writing."
Student65	Student49	1	"One thing I noticed is the statement that pressure from the threat of loss of job would not motivate adults. I didn't look at the research, but I think that would surely motivate me! LOL I'm also not sure where the monetary gain or prizes would come from in the rewards. I think your framework is sound and the concept well organized. In my experience when I was in industry, there were two types of training. The first type was the boring type: HR training on discrimination and such, and the second type, actual need-to-know skills such as training on a new tool you will need in your job function. I'm not so sure the gamification concept would work for the first type, because these are the type of trainings you just ""get through"", and bragging rights won't really entice anyone. The second type seems to be self motivating. If I had to use a new tool or learn a new set of skills for my job, I would be motivated just knowing I had not choice...I need to learn this. This is not intended to be negative. I actually see a lot of value in your concept, but I am thinking that the target audience for such a system might be a younger crowd."	9/6/2015 13:15	1402		
Student81	Student11	1	"If you are looking at Udacity, I think a bigger challenge is developing an automated agent that will match questions to the ones already asked or any question that relates to the questions since instructors can not A) be on line 24/7 to answer questions and B) want to answer questions that have already been asked. So.. For this to succeed and replace (to some degree) the office hour concept; some automated agent or demon process should be matching up questions and allow for students to get immediate feedback if someone has already asked that questions.."	9/6/2015 13:38	475		
Student81	Student74	2	"Great detail in your [firstname]et research. you have a clear understan[lastname]g of what is available. make sure that you take note of what some of these solutions do well and emulate that for the appropriate part of your solution. In other words, take the best ideas (if it makes sense) and incorporate that. Don't re invent the part of the code for the sake of invention but ba[firstname] that with inventing the new parts that need to be re-done"	9/6/2015 13:46	604	7	
Student81	Student93	2	I only understood about 1/3 of what I read. great research. I can tell this will be a very detailed research effort.	9/9/2015 23:23	229	5	It would be great to specify what sections were hard to understand so maybe I can focus on them better
Student81	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	Looks like you have a great start and a strong research topic	9/9/2015 23:27	1248		
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student33	2	"I have some experience as a volunteer teacher. I often encountered situations where students from lower income families struggled even affor[lastname]g a decent device/ internet, which can run tech heavy apps. Breaks my heart. Perhaps you may want to consider this in planning your research, esp if you are also exploring some form of blended learning aspect at home. I think you have clear goals. this is great! i wish you best of luck."	9/6/2015 14:08	561	7	"I thought about the Issue of cost. Which is why I think this will be either a school or volunteer program where you spend time teaching kids to code. As a backdrop, I am working with my father in law who recently retired as an engineering manager and we are working on developing a program to teach co[lastname]g to kids in South Dekalb here in GA."
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student4	2	"Hi [firstname], I there is a lot you are trying to accomplish here. I am not sure if you will be able to accomplish all this in a semester, perhaps some parts you can. Working in a group may help. I liked your analysis and comparisons for various tools. However, i think some of the ideas you proposed are already used in practice. Blended learning platforms are huge in academia. They are in existence since 2002. LMS (learning management systems) such as Moodle ( open source) , WebCT and Blackboard are doing well in colleges ( 70 pct have licences for either one). Pearson LMS , Blackboard , Moodle are increasingly becoming popular in K-12 schools. They allow teachers to create any content online, create online evals ,polls, quizzes, run informative reports, analytic. A lot of them have a good user interface as well. They also allow teachers to create classrooms, assign content based on students enrolled in class. Based on my experience as a teacher, I think these LMS are really strong and constantly improving. Perhaps you may not want to re-invent the wheel and concentrate more on really focusing on the real problems that you see with teaching programming and hard to understand problems in education. Good luck!"	9/6/2015 14:23	1025		
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student77	2	"This is great [firstname]. I think you may be on to something here! I agree with you about forums. I often feel overwhelmed when i open one. In all my classes thus far at gatech, each time i open a forum, i get this feeling that i am behind peers in terms of progress in class. I wish we could do something to organize the content by broader themes, automatically, to make content more manageable to go through. Perhaps when you come up with a solution to ""Automate instructor intervention notifications within the forum, that can detect when posts need the attention of an instructor"", the same logic can also help the students comb through posts effectively. I think incentives play a major role in forcing contributions in a forum. I am not an active learner, so posting on piazza for example, does not come naturally to me. But the right kind of incentive would force me to post and contribute more. May be due to ""no real consequence in terms of exams / grades"" nature of MOOC a significant incentive cannot be built in. I think stack overflow has a decent incentive approach to encourage contribution though. Also though i am a passive learner and i probably lurk more than contribute on forums, that does not mean that i don't want to help my peers succeed. I would be more inclined to write my comments/ thoughts in a tool like peer feedback. Perhaps a way to leverage individual conversations ( in a variety of formats) and some how harnessing that knowledge for the good of all may also be helpful. Well good luck, hope you manage to find a solution to this problem! I think this would help us all."	9/6/2015 14:40	1579		
kjiwani7@gatech.edu	Student83	1	"ah interesting! I think diagnosis should be a [lastname]sferable skill. I think increasingly in education, your preparedness to deal with new problems/ unknown is a better indicator of your future success. I think same underlying principles of diagnosis apply to many fields. And i think it is passively taught in approaches to learning such as problem based or project based learning. But if you can generalize and find a creative way to teach this to middle grade and high schools students, i think it would be great. Good luck!"	9/6/2015 15:26	594		
Student82	Student76	1	"Detecting boredom using Intelligent Tutoring Systems is an interesting idea. How do you detect if someone is bored? That is a great research area, but I'll admit I'm not sure how having that information is ultimately useful for an intelligent tutor. For example, in the OMS CS program we are able to start and stop lectures at our leisure. If I get bored, I stop and go do something else and continue the lecture later. It seems like [lastname]ing our learning schedule, rather than buil[lastname]g an ITS that can recognize boredom, is a cheaper and more reliable method of combating boredom."	9/6/2015 17:29	341	6	"I think [firstname]'s points are valid, however they are focused on college and beyond. My focus is on lower levels of education, but even so, emotion and motivation are two of the three pillars of education. Thus, I believe my planned research would be of significant value."
Student82	Student32	1	Sounds like a great project. I especially like the concept of being able to convert a students handwriting to text.	9/6/2015 17:35	1579		
Student82	Student16	1	The paper is organized well. There is an empty second page that can safely be deleted. The author might want to consider inclu[lastname]g a references section instead of using footnotes. Spaced repetition seems like a great learning tool. One of the criticisms of common core is that teachers are forced to teach student to pass a test. The information is forgotten soon after.	9/6/2015 19:44	249	6	
Student82	Student61	1	"The paper is well organized and the student included discussion on current research. The paper can be improved by using bold titles within tables and deleting extra columns. When I learn a new language I tend to skip basic books such as Learning Python because they typically cover the same type of knowledge. How to write a loop, print, etc... Instead I find an online tutorial that allows me to build something or I purchase a book from the Effective Series. At this point I think I own every available book for each language of the Effective series. What I like about that series is that it contains points about how to do things correctly specifically for that language."	9/6/2015 19:49	348	6	"I found a similar approach. Have given up on basic books for the exact same reason. Will have to check out the effective series, have not read one of those book yet but will soon!"
Student38	Student59	1	"This sounds like a great project - and very cool that you will be able to apply some machine learning algorithms. Do similar tools already exist? If so, are they commercial or open source? Who are the ultimate users of this tool (administrators? individual teachers?) and is there someone in these roles that can give you feedback about the project? As you say, the project is ambitious, but it sounds like there are plans to narrow the focus to a manageable project, or maybe there are others who would join you. I think there are probably a number of classmates who would enjoy a classification challenge. Good luck with your project!"	9/6/2015 17:55	894	7	Good set of questions that I should definitely follow up on. Helpful feedback!
Student38	Student67	1	"This is an interesting project. I haven't spent much time thinking about motivation, so your investigation of current theory was interesting to hear. Who will the target audience be? And, if they have motivation problems to begin with, what will be their motivation to try the app? This sounds like a worthy endeavor though, and also sounds like a fun project. Good luck as you move forward!"	9/6/2015 17:55	1620	5	
Student38	Student25	1	Everyone needs help out there in navigating the ins and outs of technology they want/need to apply. Figuring out exactly how to do it and provi[lastname]g instruction at a hands on level as well as provi[lastname]g information about what larger investments need to be made would be very helpful I would think. Who will be your target audience? Determining this may influence how you develop your result. Good luck with your project!	9/6/2015 17:55	2212	7

Student91	Student13	2	"Hello Nate, I see you are advancing your research project in a healthy way, so I expect that you will reach your planned objectives at the end of the semester. As it is with you and with many others in the OMS program, I would like that the overall OMS program is successful and gets each time stronger and stronger throughout the time. And the best way to achieve that is with this kind of participation and collaboration we are doing in this course. My project is about an AI student Learning Assistant that should help the student remember, review, and understand better the material of course. It will be also focused towards growing into an actual AI TA, with the argument that the knowledge and learning behavior captured and stored of a student can also be a valuable component for a TA's Job. And at the end this could end provi[lastname]g a Database of Students' (and/or TAs') Behaviors, to be used as review suggestions (or TAs experience examples for other TAs) for an even better experience of the user. At the end this database could be also used for research purposes as the one you are doing right now. If at any time you need a support that I am able to do, just tell me and I will be glad to help you."	9/6/2015 18:28	450		
Student91	Student2	1	"Hello [firstname], If successful, I agree that this project could be a beginning of truly starting to take advantage of mobile devices in education. For this you have to identify, and classify, what features or elements on the mobile device can actually work with enough capacity, or with advantage, on what desired (repeated or not) tasks or goals for [lastname]forcement of the learning process, normally happening on desktop computers. I feel that my project and your project cam be complementary, here is a current definition of my project: A �Student MOOC Learning Assistant� will help me easily and quickly review previous learned material from a MOOC Course for a deeper understan[lastname]g of the concepts, for preparing for an Exam, or for preparing for a future Project or Course, taking into account my previous Behavior when viewing the Lectures and other resources. This will make the learning process and the application of the learned material much more efficient and saving valuable time and indeed making the final objective more reachable. So, at the end, taking advantage of this reduced and focused student-remembered material and some Scaffol[lastname]g Techniques that I may end using, for achieving the deepening of understan[lastname]g, like: Cue cards Concept and mind maps Hints or annotations for concepts Prompts Highlighting texts on any applicable text resource, for fast re-rea[lastname]g my project can actually be a complement of yours, and also your techniques may also be a complement of mine not only on mobile devices but also on desktops. I actually think that, if successful, my project should be written for mobile devices. Good luck with your plans."	9/10/2015 2:22	112		
Student91	Student7	1	"Hello Ben, I reviewed previously your Personal Statement so I was already introduced to your idea. Your paper looks simple, but touches the very important idea of trying to address the weaknesses in each type of existing resource using a constructionist approach. I wonder if your give your project an alternative option: Instead of gui[lastname]g the learners towards just master programming with iOS, you could also base the whole course towards buil[lastname]g a big enough application. In this case the learner should be learning the different topics along the way when they are needed in buil[lastname]g the application. Because I didn't learn yet how to develop for iOS, and that's a next step for me, I will definitely be willing to try your Application when it is ready. So, you can send me a message to Student91 when you need learners to test it."	9/12/2015 18:34	1808		
Student91	Student64	1	"Hello [firstname], you are right with your intention researching how to better get this useful student data would be very important. I would like now to introduce a little bit to my project that is also about capturing student behavior while studying a MOOC and using it as a Memory to help them review the materials, here is a definition of it: A �Student MOOC Learning Assistant� will help me easily and quickly review previous learned material from a MOOC Course for a deeper understan[lastname]g of the concepts, for preparing for an Exam, or for preparing for a future Project or Course, taking into account my previous Behavior when viewing the Lectures and other resources. This will make the learning process and the application of the learned material much more efficient and saving valuable time and indeed making the final objective more reachable. Basically this is another way of getting students' relevant information also for analysis and recommendation tasks. But a tool like this can also be used to ask the questions you may end suggesting for a survey solution, but during key moments of the study process. I know this cannot happen at this time, but it shows how amazing this course may result. I already give several Peer Review Feedback of projects/Researches that can connect, integrate, or complement to mine. I am pretty sure other students of this course also feel like that. Good luck in your project/research, and hopefully all this feedback process is being useful also to you as it is being to me."	9/12/2015 20:44	970		
Student24	Student81	1	Sounds like a good research project [firstname] and you have quite narrowed down to specific area to focus on. Although I am not too aware of this technology myself expect that Microsoft windows 10 was going to support holographic computing with APIs. The whole concept of overlaying virtual world into reality sounds like right out of a Science fiction movie. But as you have pointed out there are some real world implications of the technology which makes it very attractive. Waiting to see what comes out of your research fin[lastname]g.	9/6/2015 18:40	1952	4	
Student24	Student70	1	"Hi [firstname] this is a very interesting concept for project. Often times you visit a blog going by the title or the hea[lastname]g of the topic which might have came back in Google search. Although the topic might be what you are interested in fin[lastname]g out more, you feel disappointed by the actual content of the blog. An app which can successfully evaluate and rate the blog will be very handy. It can save some time and most important lessen the frustration of wasting time. There are few online tools available like Nibbler, [firstname]a etc. which do provide good rating services. Here you can find some common ones: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001291.htm Good luck with the app."	9/6/2015 19:12	1366	6	
Student24	Student87	1	"Hi Student87 very fascinating subject for a project specially looking through augmented reality. When I first came to US, I was also quite surprised at students lack of interest in the STEM subjects in general. Because where I come from STEM subjects are highly in demand and there are only limited number of seats available for students. The other key matrix is the huge gender gap when you look at STEM related fields. Something like augmented reality will certainly help boost up the students interest in these subjects and may even close the gender gap. Your proposed solution makes it look quite achievable. I would love to followup on your proposed solution and like to see how it shapes up."	9/6/2015 19:37	1834		
Student24	Student56	2	"Hi [firstname]. I think this is a very important study and adds a lot of value in ways of mesuring effectiveness of Standardized tests. As you mentioned Standardized tests does not provide true measure of quality of education and knowledge gained by students. They merely provide a snapshot at a given point in time of students course of learning. I think Standardized tests are more tailored to satisfy the requirements laid out by government in ""No Child Left Behind Act"". Schools are more concerned about receiving government fun[lastname]g as well as how much autonomy they can have. This might be due to fear of state government taking over school operations and having less control to make independent decisions of their own. There have also been instances that this presure has led to cheating and score manipulation at some schools. There is tremendous pressure on school officials, inclu[lastname]g teachers and students themselves to show results which often times leads to ""teach to the test"" paradigm that you pointed out. Good luck! Looking forward to know more about the study."	9/7/2015 10:15	221	4	
Student6	Student3	0	"I was expecting more detail on one poten[firstname]l project or research idea. The way I read this paper, the upcoming work is briefly mentioned in the final paragraph of the paper. There is a lot of detail regar[lastname]g the subject area, but that seems to be the focus of the paper. The paper mentions a poten[firstname]l idea, and then abruptly ends. The first assignment was mentioned in this paper, but it was not referenced or included in this assignment. Finally, four websites were referenced, but there was no tie in to these references within the paper. It is possible to infer what ideas within the paper match to the references, but it would be much easier if the ideas within the paper were tied to the references."	9/6/2015 21:50	2516	3	Did I misunderstand the objective of this assignment? The subject area background is critical information to understand the problems presented. This assignment was geared towards fine-tuning the poten[firstname]l problems to address; not actually start addressing / researching them. I do not see the disconnect on the references within the paper. Specific information such as $ amount was utilized and requires a reference.
Student6	Student88	1	"I learned something by rea[lastname]g this paper. I feel that you did a good job of researching the problem space and describing the results of your research. I appreciate the fact that you referenced and included your first assignment, so that I can see the build-up of the work that you have done to date. I also like the fact that you state your problem space early in the document. I can see your high level approach to the problem throughout the paper. I did not see specific references listed in the paper, that is one thing that I found lacking. Another aspect that you may want to consider is the Udacity nano-degree model. There are several projects to complete, and a personalized assessment is provided to guide you if you are running into problems."	9/7/2015 1:10	12		
Student6	Student98	1	"The use of data analytics to help students self-assess will be challenging. This problem is exacerbated when looking at underprivileged students. I think that collecting the data will be very challenging. I have four children in school, and none of their [firstname]s are recorded in an electronic format. Recor[lastname]g data for use in data analytics would be additional work for the teacher, as it is not currently part of their process. Expecting all schools to be able to collect sufficient data for analytics is not a realistic option. Focusing on underprivileged kids will likely mean focusing on areas that are under-served by technology. I think that data points that could significantly affect student performance will not be captured, such as food, home environment, or peer pressure (bullying) as a few examples. I am not suggesting that data analytics is not a good solution. But I believe collecting the data will be much more challenging than you are suggesting."	9/7/2015 1:10	2320	5	"I could come up with possible solutions for students to take charge of their own life by having students input their own grades. This way, teachers will not spend time inputting data into the system. Students can also take weekly surveys to track performance. Being an underprivileged kid does not necessarily mean that you do not have access to a computer. Currently students have access to computers in libraries and study halls. But in cases where students do not have access to computers, leadership should ensure that technology is accessible."
Student6	Student99	0	"My ini[firstname]l reaction upon rea[lastname]g the proposed solution was that it was very high level. When rea[lastname]g the Proposed Solution, there isn't a specific proposal or project, but a general description of a problem area. I did not see any information on any research done to determine what tools currently exist in this problem space, if any. You do reference the NMC Horizon Report, but it would have been helpful to reference a particular area or section of the report instead of using the entire report as a reference."	9/7/2015 1:49	2262	5	
Student83	Student66	1	"Nice work, it looks like you are on a good track and have learned a lot that will help with the project. It would have been nice to have some concrete examples to back up the trends you observed, but that is a minor quibble. This sounds like it will be a fun project, good luck with it."	9/6/2015 22:25	681		
Student83	Student33	1	This sounds like it will be a very worthwhile project. Another nice thing about Scratch is that it doesn't require a powerful computer - even a $25 Raspberry Pi will work for it. It would be interesting to learn how other programs have tried to integrate the tools you've talked about into the curriculum for low income schools.	9/6/2015 22:37	834	7	"Thanks for the feedback [firstname]. I never thought about the Rasperberry Pi but that is a great idea. I think that it has to start somewhere and as far as the issue of cost is concerned I think in some cases it has to be an after school or volunteer program where you spend time teaching kids to code. As a backdrop, I am working with my father in law who recently retired as an engineering manager and we are working on developing a program to teach co[lastname]g to kids in South Dekalb here in GA."
Student83	Student77	2	Great work. It looks like you've found some great research to springboard from. Good luck with this ambitious project.	9/6/2015 22:52	750		
Student83	Student4	1	This is a well done and thorough analysis of existing tools/platforms and a well thought out evaluation of what is needed to address the problem. It looks like you are well on your way to understan[lastname]g the problem and addressing it.	9/6/2015 23:05	533		
Student28	Student61	1	"Looks like you dive into solution approach already. If you haven't look at https://www.co[lastname]game.com/, I strongly suggest it and try it out with different programming language. Hope that helps your project going forward!"	9/6/2015 22:43	168	5	Yup have checked out co[lastname]g game. It is very interesting but I have not figured out how it can help [lastname]sfer knowledge yet.
Student28	Student82	1	"[firstname], these are all interesting methods to explore. If you could build an auto-grader for essays, I am sure many companies will be knocking on your door. Good luck and interested to hear how your project progress!"	9/6/2015 22:48	355	6	I'll keep you updated in Slack.
Student28	Student90	2	"I am not familiar with Developmental Dyscalculia. Thank you for enlighten me! There are a lot of interesting methods in your paper, especially about self-esteem. One of the four main values from my high school (a junior Naval ROTC) was self-esteem. At the time, I didn't take it to heart, but years later, I realize that what you ""think"" of your ability makes a big difference. I strongly believe how a child sees him/herself makes a difference in learning. A system that could help empower the child's self-esteem would help them learn better. Sharing one of my favor Henry Ford quotes - ""Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."""	9/6/2015 22:56	941	7	Great quote!!
Student28	Student32	1	"Great to heard you team up with Tricia! I am learning a lot from her via Piazza about the challenges teachers face in modern classroom. Coming from the technology side, I also fell into the trap of forgotten to look at from the teachers perspective. She offer good points that I haven't considered in my usual usual role designing corporate products. I am looking forward to see your project result!"	9/6/2015 23:12	336		
Student45	Student101	1	"Hi [firstname], I really like your idea because it happens very frequently and results in wastage of precious time. I recently attended a workshop in which the instructor's internet browser won't show up when she minimized the slides to take us for a walk-through of the concept. She asked if any body from the audience had any experience with projectors and problems like this, but to no avail. She tried few different things because demo was the main highlight of the workshop. After struggling for good 10-15 minutes,s he called one of the organizers and requested help for sorting out the issue. By the time the problem was fixed, we lost good 20-25 minutes, which is a lot of time for a two hour workshop. If she was trained or had knew exactly whom to contact, it could have saved us some time and the session could have been much more useful. And I must say that you are an inspiration for me. I am very proud to be studying among heroes like you, who do not let any obstacles stop them."	9/6/2015 22:24	1372	7	
Student45	Student51	2	I like that you actually put your learning into practice and experimented by Video Modeling. Its always the best way to learn. You have definitely identified some of the challenges at a very early stage. Glad to know that Video Modeling is proving effective for your son. I am very eager to see your next assignments how things go from here. Good luck	9/6/2015 23:14	483	6	
Student45	Student40	1	"HI [firstname], I have no experience in teaching and never thought about an Integrated Faculty Website System. This was a good read for me and I learned something so new toady. The assignment gives a very good insight into what is available in the [firstname]et, pros and cons and etc. However, there was one attendance tool used at by Infosys when I was training with them. Everybody was allocated a desktop in our class and an attendance client was installed on each of the machines, which was linked with our account. The instructor use to open the bridge for one minute time, so that all students can submit their attendance. It was very effective and the only time I experienced use of an attendance tool. But I am not sure how relevant could this be to your project. Anyways, good luck!"	9/6/2015 23:27	1485		
Student45	Student17	1	"I moved to US recently and have always seen a traditional black board on which teacher will use chalk to write back in my home country. So, rea[lastname]g about Blackboard software was new learning for me. Hence I found your write up very interesting. I do agree that if students are asked to do more tasks on their laptops they will use them for sure. It a matter of helping them develop this habit."	9/6/2015 23:52	552		
Student54	Student2	1	I like your argument that mobile isn't integrated to the fullest extent possible when considering poten[firstname]l learning outcomes. I agree that mobile devices and educational content is a great intersection to explore further. Good luck to you.	9/6/2015 23:49	143		
Student54	Student91	0	Interesting ideas. The one that stood out most to me when I read it was using artificial intelligence to motivate students. I agree that this is an ambitious project that could take much longer than a single semester. Good luck! Looking forward to seeing what you come up with.	9/6/2015 23:52	159	7	
Student54	Student94	1	"Enhancing the Montessori methodology is an interesting project. However, it wasn't clear to me what question you would like to solve and by which method do you intend to solve it. I understand what you want to accomplish. But I'm curious how you would go about accomplishing it."	9/6/2015 23:54	190		
Student54	Student47	1	Very interesting and relevant topic. Minimizing disruptive behavior and acquiring a deeper understan[lastname]g of its components could lead to some very interesting conclusions which could become very practical and useful knowledge for teachers. Good luck with your project!	9/6/2015 23:58	161		
Student42	Student84	1	"This certainly sounds like an interesting and ambitious project goal. I am curious as to how the product of the information that your users would be getting from the site would differ from what they get at the standard well child visits at their pediatrician. And, as you pointed out in your assignment 1, parents can be somewhat obsessive about developmental milestones, so how are they likely to interpret/misinterpret this data without a physician to provide context. Also, how do you think users will feel about provi[lastname]g developmental details to a website if they've already provided the same data at the doctor's office, and how do you plan on addressing the privacy/confiden[firstname]lity concerns that are already offered by HIPAA?"	9/7/2015 0:13	17	4	Unfortunately this feedback isn't very useful for me since the questions are answered in my document. I can't decide whether I wasn't clear on my value proposition or the reader missed those points that he raised questions about. I'll keep his questions handy and ask my mentor's opinion and instructors on the clarity of my document vs the questions answered. Maybe I can spot improvements.
Student42	Student8	1	"This sounds like an interesting approach to helping students with autism help to grasp social norms. When I was researching my own project, I came across an article regar[lastname]g how students sometimes miss out on educational targets of interactive apps/games because they are focused on the completion goals of the game. The story referred specifically to smartphone/tablet apps that have interactive storytelling with embedded mini-games or touch activities to advance the story, but the upshot was that the students sometimes missed the details of plot/setting/characters because they were focused on game aspect more than the story aspect. I don't know if this is something that overlaps with children on the spectrum or would even apply to your use case, but something to consider?"	9/7/2015 0:13	639	1	That is something to really think about and something I have been trying to ba[firstname]. Amazing.
Student42	Student95	1	"Sounds like you have extensive background knowledge on the topic. Just curious, what do you want to produce as a result of the project other than a bill of materials that meet your requirements? Were you planning on implementing the project with students this semester and inclu[lastname]g some additional research based upon your results? Just curious as to what the content of the publish-ready paper we're supposed to be producing might be in your case."	9/7/2015 0:24	618		
Student42	Student78	1	"I was interested to read your research summary on intelligent tutoring systems as I'm working on a similar problem myself. Particularly where you mentioned that work is being done to develop systems that attempt to simulate human conversation. I was looking for research on this exact topic in hopes of poten[firstname]lly leveraging it for intervention on early childhood students with language deficits due to low socio-economic status, developmental delay or ESL, so if you have any specific articles you could point me to, I'd be very interested!"	9/7/2015 0:34	370		
Student35	Student71	1	"The paper does a good job of highlighting an area that could benefit from educational technology tools. The paper captures succinctly some of the uses of such a technology, as well. For instance, and as you rightly point out, a well-designed soft skills ""refresher"" mobile app would be valuable to social program administrators, government officials, and students who go through such a program. In summary, the document addresses the assignment requirements well. An observation, or a minor comment, is that using sections or hea[lastname]gs such as ""Background"" and ""Existing Tools"" could be useful in further organizing the document."	9/7/2015 10:01	2246	6	This feedback was helpful from the standpoint of validation of direction.
Student35	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	"This seems to be an important goal to pursue, as it may turn out (it depends on what the project research unfolds) that some of the processes are not suitable (too complex?) for K-12 districts and new processes are needed. For this reason, and many others, creating an understan[lastname]g about why some schools do not follow a systematic approach is important. The document does a good job of outlining what phases constitute a well-developed technology adoption process. My only question is this: Does the author also intend to create a set of recommendations (that is, make a case for adopting formal processes)?"	9/7/2015 10:40	1546	7	"Yes, I plan to give recommendations."
Student35	Student34	1	"A well-organized paper. It communicates the end goal (improve CS 6505 experience) and mechanism (evaluate Peer Feedback tool in the context of teaching CS 6505) clearly, succinctly, and effectively.

It might be useful to note related research efforts in the document."	9/7/2015 11:06	2218		
Student35	Student79	1	"This paper was a pleasure to read. It outlines the problem, related work, methodologies, challenges and roadmap in a well-organized manner.

Student93	Student77	1	"This is a very well organized reflection around good problems. I was especially intrigued by the ""enabling of passive learning"" which I am personally an example of -- I am not a big fan of posting on forums and I do not like much interaction with the rest of the students. However I am a huge fan on learning and I often feel that my style of learning is largely ignored. I am very curious of what solution you will come up with and I would like to follow up later. The only thing that I would recommend is settling on one problem given that mini-proposal is due this week and you trying to tackle three different problems."	9/7/2015 10:25	953		
Student93	Student33	1	I love the idea of bridging the gap in education for kids with lower income --- I am not sure if there are already programs tackling that since I do not have a teaching background. There are a couple suggestions I could make: -- organize the reflection around sections for problem definition and poten[firstname]l solutions. -- add references of utilized literature (so far you have only added one) -- describe in a little more detail how Scratch and similar tools can solve the problem you are trying to address. You did a pretty good job describing the the poten[firstname]l effect of introducing them to low income communities. It would be interesting to see in the proposal what exactly are you going to do about them and how far are you going to go? What do you envision the outcome of the study to be?	9/7/2015 12:59	489		
Student93	Student83	1	"The topic of diagnostics was one of my favorite topics in the [firstname]'s KBAI summer session so I have a soft spot for it. I completely agree that a debugging/troubleshooting skill is largely ignored in the schools. I have very good examples where interns in their Masters CS degree have no clue on how to diagnose issues in the software. Incidentally, the project they are working on is exactly creating a diagnostic AI agent for buil[lastname]g hypothesis about failures in the specific software. I will be very curious to follow up on your report later!"	9/7/2015 13:50	831		
Student93	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"Hi Kamran, I think the topic you have chosen is very good and it requires attention. I do not have any experience in either of the LMS tools you have specified so my feedback might not be very relevant. What I would recommend however is diving deeper in the topic -- I couldn't quite gauge the solution you are going for. You have started identifying the gaps in existing LMS technologies and you could go further on ideas for solving it. Good luck -- I am curious of what the outcome will be."	9/7/2015 14:04	999		
Student88	Student98	1	"Interesting idea - how would you collect all this information? Have the student provide it? I do think that [lastname]ing the password quarter does not remove privacy as a concern. That may remove the threat of someone gaining access, but how is the data stored? who has control over the data? with whom is the data shared? does the data get collected and shared out via some anonymized method (of which many have been proved to not work)? It will be interesting to see where you go with this!"	9/7/2015 10:48	353	6	Feedback has helped me realize that I forgot about the database that the tool depends on. I will make the proper adjustment to the assignment to include these questions going forward. Thanks!
Student88	Student3	1	"First, thank you for the background at the beginning. Great break down of the issue, definitely learned from your paper! I completely agree with your point under 1. a. I went to a charter school and watched administrators fight over our technology deployment, costs, and methods. It was truly amazing to see how heated it would get and how unfortunate the solution was."	9/7/2015 10:48	949	7	Useful to know that someone with a Charter background / experience understands and agrees with the problem presented.
Student88	Student99	1	"I would only add, what other things exist out there today that you can build on top of? Maybe pick one of the items that seems the most interesting or go research each of them and determine where you could most add value."	9/7/2015 11:29	54	5	
Student88	Student44	1	"Interesting set of links. I would however wonder why there are no links or papers to UX design? If I understood your research question around UI then I would expect maybe some research or industry papers on best practices of UX and UI in general, more than looking at the best apps out there."	9/7/2015 10:48	2648		
Student10	Student6	1	"Wow, this sounds really interesting - not sure that I have any specific advice concerning linear accelerators though. One thing that I might suggest is to compartmentalize any libraries used to perform calculations. That in and of itself might be valuable - if you built the platform, others would be able to build the tools that sit on top of it. So it might be worthwhile to release a library for doing these calculations, and then a GUI on top of it as a separate project (so that both could be developed independently). On simulation: I think that it's very important that simulation matches the real world workflow as closely as possible - ideally I would think that people would be using the same machines, although they would not be shooting out radiation beams. On licenses: with GPL, your code and any derivative code is automatically under the GPL, which provides users the right to the source code. Generally this is a great license, but it's very strong - it would make it hard to sell software directly, as any customers would have right to the full unaltered source code. LGPL is designed for libraries - other people can build software on top of your library without their code being part of the LGPL. So that is probably the license that you would want to use."	9/7/2015 11:06	591	6	"This was helpful. I asked the reader for questions as part of the assignment, and they took the time to read through my paper and try to answer what they could."
Student10	Student88	2	"Very well done - certainly over the word limit, but I feel that you used the extra time very well. So great work! I really like the idea of improving quizzes. As a consumer of educational technology, I really wish that quizzes were more generative - often there's one quiz question on a subject that you can answer without truly understan[lastname]g it. Khan Academy would be the other Ed Tech platform to look into, and in many ways they are more advanced in this regard, as quizzes are their main mechanism of understan[lastname]g learning. Here's a blog post (probably very outdated by now) about how they try to evaluate whether students understand a concept: http://[firstname]-hu.com/2011/11/02/how-khan-academy-is-using-machine-learning-to-assess-student-mastery.html This is somewhat tangen[firstname]l, but on the topic of quizzing, one area that I'm really excited about is spaced repetition https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition which I think would be very valuable when used with quizzes in lectures and classes."	9/7/2015 11:16	493	7	"This is probably the most helpful feedback, outside of my mentors, that I have received thus far."
Student10	Student98	1	"The questions left unanswered to me here is: what already exists? Courses are certainly already collecting a lot of data - how are they using it? Can demographic data actually help students, or does it risk hurting them if they are exposed to it directly? Accor[lastname]g to a lot of research, when people are ""primed"" as being part of an stereotypical under-performing demographic, this alone ends up causing them to under-perform (and conversely when not primed, performance differences disappear). This is a really interesting report worth rea[lastname]g, on the problems with getting minorities into STEM fields: http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/Why-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf Finally, as you talk about security, be careful about making up ad-hoc solutions. Often people do things that sound secure (encrypt everything! Have passwords expire every week!) without truly understan[lastname]g what they are doing, and so inevitably overlook the real security flaws in their system (the classic build a foot thick steel door, only to have the thief break in through the window instead)."	9/7/2015 11:24	831	3	I think the reader did not realize that this topic is for grades ranging from 3rd grade to seniors in high school. I'll be sure to clarify. My research did not provide the answers to the reviewers question. It would have been helpful for them to provide links to back up their facts for the first sentence.
Student10	Student99	1	"""EdTech innovators often only have a surface �level understan[lastname]g of the current state of education, the history of education, and the past, present, and future impacts of technology on education"". I think this is probably true, but I'd put a big [CITATION NEEDED] here. It may just be the nature of this assignment, but it's not clear to me from what you are writing what the problem is that you are trying to solve. Your list has several very different ideas, and while individually I think that they are strong, what I don't see is how they interact with each other - what is the ultimate goal? Each of the ideas you enumerate seems really good, and I get the impression that you have a really strong idea of what you want to do though, I would recommend more clearly defining it. Again though, it might just be the nature of the assignment."	9/7/2015 11:38	321		
Student67	Student68	1	"Hi [firstname], I found your assignment 2 quite interesting. I agree that many school programs out there are not using technology correctly. One thing that I found quite surprising was when you mentioned, "" there is a big push in high schools to turn away from the model of preparing students for a career to preparing them for college."" I thought it was the opposite and that the curriculum has been shifting towards preparing teens for the workforce. Maybe this in an area I need to look into it more :) Overall, great job and can't wait to see what you come up with for your project!"	9/7/2015 11:24	597		
Student67	Student72	1	"Hi [firstname], I think your topic of research is quite interesting. I do not have much background about Montessori schools so your overview of the materials used in these schools definitely helped me. One thing that was not very clear is if you planned to write a paper, do a project, or both. The reason I was wondering is how are you planning to tackle this problem. If this is an area that has not been researched much, then doing a prototype and a paper would make sense since you would be able to explain your fin[lastname]gs using the data gathered. Overall, great idea and look forward to seeing what you end up doing here! Good luck!"	9/7/2015 11:34	1142	5	
Student67	Student37	1	"Hi, I think your way of boosting innovation, problem solving, and creativity at large scale companies is quite interesting. Particularly, I like the fact of bringing an outside consultant when it comes to the judging. One thing that was not too clear to me was how are you planning to test out your approach. Will you try to push this at your company? or research to see if this type of approach has been done before? Overall, great job and look forward to seeing what you come up!"	9/7/2015 11:53	501		
Student67	Student1	1	"Hi Sam, I think the problem you are trying to tackle is quite interesting and definitely one that has been talked a lot. I suggest you also take a look at some of the motivational theories out there and see if play a role in keeping a student engage in online courses (and maybe how technology can help). The results in the experiment of the physics course was for some reason not surprising to me. Sometime making things too flexible (such as watching the lectures on video) can lead to people not to adequately engage in the material (there are just too many distractions). Overall, I think you have a great topic and see you have already made good progress on your research. Good luck!"	9/7/2015 12:01	666	7	
Student40	Student18	2	"Very well written [firstname]! Thank you for sharing your perspective and feedback on what I know is typically very US-oriented at times (particularly in this class since a lot of the discussions are related around themes/topics that come up more over here). I think lots of folks would find your perspective illuminating (particularly for example, your comment about the time your proxy was turned off and that caused an issue with your GT account, plus the fact you don't have Youtube access in your country is particularly difficult because it prevents you from watching the course material on Udacity, etc.). When I saw that you were focusing on underserved communities at the start of your paper I was interested in rea[lastname]g more, primarily because I feel like my own community (while not having nearly the same challenges as your own) here in Southern California (close to the Mexican border in Imperial County) has its own challenges. For example, while in the main city areas broadband access isn't really a problem, once you move away from the centers of each of our cities it can become more difficult to get broadband access. If it weren't for my work at the college, and them graciously allowing me to setup a wireless point-to-point connection back to the campus, my access would be limited to either 56k dial-up, or a wireless broadband option that is very limited in speed (about 0.5-1.0 Mbps). The other challenge at times for our students, especially at the college, is limited access to technology at home or not having great [lastname]sportation (and our public bus system isn't that great either, and since our community is spread out over a large area, there's a lot to ground to cover and you can't walk to the campus easily). Different challenges to be sure, but I think it might also par[firstname]lly be due to lack of awareness and I feel research and information provided by folks that are directly affected by these challenges (such as yourself) is greatly welcomed and will hopefully lead to certain [lastname]es that will improve the experience in the future for other students :-)."	9/7/2015 11:27	1629	6	
Student40	Student51	2	"Hi [firstname]! Very interesting and very personal, thank you for sharing your tests/results so far :-). I think the first thing that does jump out at me is the time/difficulty the ""Self"" Video Modeling adds to the equation (compared to the Peer Video Modeling one might get from watching Youtube and other videos if I'm understan[lastname]g the differences correctly). The Look at Me Now website offers an interesting solution, but the final effect in their case does appear rather cheesy from what I quickly saw watching one of their example videos (it would be interesting to find out if their approach superimposing your child's photo into the video is as effective as going through the whole process individually with your own child). In your case you have a level of technical knowledge where you aren't intimidated by going through the video editing process, but I could see this as being a roadblock for other parents of autistic children. One thought I had during the process of rea[lastname]g your assignment that came up, was whether or not photo realism is required. For example, if the movies were instead animated, and there was a process to create an avatar representation that a child identifies with (and can interpret as being them), then that might make it a lot easier to integrate a child's avatar into a wide variety of animated videos easily (in a program such as Adobe Flash, the character would exist on its layer, so it seems like it could be switched out for another, different looking character quite easily). (The avatar creation process that first came to mind was this one using the Xbox One Kinect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD_wfRbSYXA). I'm not sure though if the animated+avatar approach for putting books away would be as effective as the more real video that you were able to create for Ambrose. And getting the resources available to create the animated+avatar approach might be considerable so it would hard to do a comparison at this time (but I would certainly be curious if the animated+avatar approach was as effective). Overall it's a very interesting project to be working on, and I'm glad it's provided some positive results so far for you and hope it continues to do so :-)."	9/7/2015 11:54	3228	7	
Student40	Student101	1	"Hi [firstname]! You bring up some of the very same topics we are challenged with at the college I work for and mention a lot of the same tools we've tried to use to get the instructors up-to-speed with the technology available. First I'll start off with that the examples you listed as being an instructor issue can also be a student issue and take just as much time out of the class. For example, this past week in my classroom on Thursday night I had placed some material on a fileshare on our fileserver (e.g. \\fileserver\cis214) and I asked the students to pull up some material I had placed on there for them. Even though the instructions were written on the board some students were having a tough time following them so I had to take a few moments to go around and help them out. Since this class is about teaching web development (PHP/MySQL) the other struggle I run into is students not knowing where the ""address bar"" is in their browsers and other things that end up slowing down the process during teaching them in class. Going back to instructors, for Blackboard we have contracted with Blackboard's support service (so there's a 24/7 800 number that instructors and students can call for support). However, it's not heavily utilized. Prior to Blackboard, with our old Course Management System we had an onsite person dedicated to supporting staff/students, but it was only during regular working hours. Over the past 3 years or so, we've improved the quality of basic technology in our classrooms so that all of them are equipped with some essen[firstname]ls: a lectern PC, a projector, a document camera, etc. Some classrooms are setup a little differently (the newer ones vs. the older ones which were retrofitted with new lectern equipment), but aside from some differences with the buttons that need to be pressed they are fairly similar and not too complicated to use. We also occasionally offer training for new faculty (but the last time we did this, we maybe got one or two people actually show up). So sometimes it seems like scheduling those trainings is more of an issue (part-time faculty especially have trouble since most have other jobs and can't come onsite easily during the day). Another issue though is that sometimes it just feels like the faculty members aren't interested (and since the trainings aren't mandatory there isn't a strong incentive for them to go). During the first few weeks of the semester we also tend to offer extended support hours onsite (by keeping one of the technicians available until 7 PM). However we only did this for the first two weeks of this semester and won't be keeping those hours for the full semester. We find that our newer part-time instructors are actually the ones most willing to learn and adapt to the technology available to them...most complaints we receive are from our full-time faculty who say they need training (but then might not show up to the trainings that are offered creating a bit of a conundrum for us in IT, since we don't do training full-time and need to move onto our other projects/tasks). Something I've been trying to do more recently is creating video tutorials using Camtasia and posting those online to Youtube and sharing with instructors (I'm actually planning on doing this to go over / introduce Mirroring360 which we added to most of our lectern PCs at the start of the semester...however I haven't sent out an official announcement about it so it's probably not being used yet). Another piece of information we added to our lecterns, was an instruction sheet going over the basics of getting into the PC, turning on the equipment, etc. along with some basic troubleshooting tips. However, we find that these tend to get ignored (for example, when someone calls into the IT Helpdesk during the day and we find out that the question they have would have easily been fixed by rea[lastname]g the sheet in more detail). While instructors give short shrift to students not rea[lastname]g instructions carefully...the same can also be said about instructors at times. So I didn't provide a ton of feedback about your paper directly, but I just wanted to share that the items you listed are indeed real ones and we've tried the full gamut of options you listed so if you find out any significant, research-backed tips that are more effective, please let me know (because we'd like to implement them :-)."	9/7/2015 12:48	1372		
Student40	Student29	1	"Hi [firstname], I'm sure a bunch of kids out there will appreciate this project, which would make it easier for schools to integrate Minecraft into their curriculum :-). So far I haven't seen Minecraft used to teach programming as much as the other ones your mentioned (such as Scratch), but I have seen this book: https://pragprog.com/book/ahmine2/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins I've been experimenting with a few phone apps, such as Move the Turtle, with my daughter but so far I feel she might be a little young to fully get into the game (she's getting close to 7 now). Additionally, ever since I left Berkeley and I've had to teach my own web programming courses here in Southern California I've been experimenting with ways I could bring in some of the approaches my first CS instructor taught me: https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ ([firstname] has a ton of material on this page...at Berkeley they used Scheme and his book plus another one fondly called ""SICP"", but also at the bottom of the page are 3 books on the Logo Programming language that are freely available to download). What I've come to realize is that there is so much information available, and while it's all mostly still relevant and good, some of it isn't as applicable anymore. For example, when [firstname] was teaching in high school back in his day, programming at the command line without a GUI was probably relatively common. To do so now with our students, we might lose them right away, which is probably why new environments such as Scratch's, were invented...that way students have a funner visual environment to learn in. Throwing Minecraft into that mix though, it wasn't originally intended to be a programming/teaching environment (I'm guessing the best way to describe it as a world buil[lastname]g application/game?) so now some of those pieces are probably being bolted on after-the-fact (which might be easier now that Microsoft owns the company that makes Minecraft). For me personally, in the classes I've been asked to teach occasionally here at the college my main struggle has been: How do I teach programming, while at the same time teaching all of the concepts needed to do web development (at the same time) in a single semester? It's a tough problem for me. (Most of my students don't have a proper programming background, and the other programming classes we teach don't seem to do a great job of it, so I'm both trying to teach some of those concepts, and also trying to give the students more information specific to programming for the web, so it's a lot of material and ground to cover and I always feel like I'm unable to do well in either). From my perspective, all work going towards making learning to program more fun and accessible to more students (and adults) is welcome in my book, so I really hope you're able to find a good path forward towards adapting some of the other content that's available and making it available for those using Minecraft in the classroom :-). That's probably a nice segue for me to finish up my feedback here and go and start working on some more material for my class :-)!"	9/7/2015 13:11	1293	7	"Wow.

I like the table you created to compare the existing solutions. I think you've done some good work in reviewing existing solutions on the [firstname]et. Some concerns I have are that video is expensive to store. With the solution being centered around video recorded on iPads, I would be concerned about the limited storage of iPads. I just did a quick google and this reddit thread indicates 1 hour of video was 10 GB (https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1ep3ip/ipad_video_recor[lastname]g_length/). I would look into this more as you may want to consider compressing on the fly which would cost CPU cycles of the iPad. Another consideration is the cost/time of [lastname]smitting the recor[lastname]g of the student's reactions to the teacher. You will definitely have to compress the file to make this a reasonable task. I would imagine it's possible to just compress the video on the fly and store it in the cloud which could alleviate any storage concerns."	9/7/2015 12:07	1157	7	
Student11	Student93	0	"Appendix B gave me a good chuckle. I've had that issue with some code before where I see that the code has been modified. It's not quite as easy to spot, but Undo (CTRL+Z) seems to resolve the issue generally. I'm not narcoleptic though, I just have a tendency to doze off. Anyway, I like the idea and find it pretty unique. I was going to suggest utilizing a webcam (since most laptops have these built in now) to help monitor the user, but I see that you've already considered that. Eye tracking is a solved problem, although I'm not sure if determining whether a user is asleep has been solved via image recognition. I think that tracking eye activity in addition to keystrokes would be a good indicator especially for those instances when a user is rea[lastname]g. I would consider using the video camera as part of the solution and not just during the ini[firstname]l stages. Good luck!"	9/7/2015 12:27	1117	7	Definite indication that the reviewer had read the reflection despite the intimidating length. Also the suggestions are pretty good and I think I will try the video as some point again
Student11	Student83	0	"I think diagnosis is something that is learned through experience. It's a challenging problem and I'm interested in how you propose to teach diagnostic skills. Have you looked at car repair manuals? I haven't looked at one in ages, but as I recall, they have a section for diagnosing issues where they'll list symptoms and based upon the symptoms it guides you towards the relevant section in the manual."	9/7/2015 12:50	659		
Student7	Student64	1	You did a good job introducing your general topic of interest. You have a thorough description of the existing intelligent tutoring systems. The information you provided about InBloom was interesting.	9/7/2015 12:58	472	6	
Student7	Student22	1	"You have a lot of interesting ideas. Are you planning on writing a research paper or creating a tool or curriculum to teach middle school students to code? Are you planning to modify you seven-course Java sequence based on what you learn? You listed a lot of questions. Will you answer them through researching existing work by other authors, or are you planning on doing surveys or experiments of your own?"	9/7/2015 13:06	1249		
Student7	Student65	1	I like that your idea sounds like it was formed from a personal need. You did a very good job of enumerating your goals and stretch goals for the project. I think you have created a good roadmap for yourself to follow during the rest of the semester. You did a good job comparing your solution with existing options that address similar problems and why your solution will be better.	9/7/2015 15:30	8	6	
Student7	Student48	1	"You did a good job explaining distributed learning and the problem of education inequalities that it is meant to solve. You asked some questions in your paper about where the distributed learning concept breaks down. Do you know how you will answer these questions?

Student48	Student80	1	"Interesting hypotheses, i'm curious to see where this idea goes. It will be interesting to see the results of your research. Such as how do multiple leaders in a group conflict with each other vs a single leader and the rest of the group just following. Ideally equal cooperation is a goal i think, but will that dissuade members from taking risk with bold ideas?"	9/7/2015 13:44	179		
Student48	Student49	2	Very interesting proposal. I like the idea of breaking the course material into smaller mediums. For OMSCS I perform must of my rea[lastname]gs on the bus ride to and from work. The more courses can be designed so that smaller chunks can be ingested and understood at a time it will improve adult learning experience. It would be curious how much of this concept could be applied to children too. Since I remember in middle and high school after the first 45 minutes of a multi hour course it was difficult to keep paying attention.	9/7/2015 13:47	325		
Student48	Student24	2	"Great description of the problem and your proposed solution. This could be very helpful for group buil[lastname]g for courses. Especially if it gives the professor the ability to group using their own method. Such as the common grouping would be similar background, but there is also significant benefit sometimes to working in a diverse environment."	9/7/2015 13:53	398		
Student51	Student75	1	"[firstname], You have a lofty goal that has alot of challenges, I wish you the best of luck. From your write up it was unclear if your planning a new registration system or just a survey tool. So some of these might not apply, but here our some questions I would suggest you consider addressing if you haven't already. 1: How will your system interface with Banner. 2: How will you handle when a course is dropped or added at the last minute, like 6460 and Big Data for Health Informatics? 3: What information in the system is protected under Ferpa and will require special considerations / protections. 4: Are there any considerations that have to be made to make sure students with disabilities are properly accommodated and the tool is accessible to all ? 5: How will you handle students that want to [lastname]e their preferences 6: What are the big benefits for the advisers, profs, and students of your system over the current one."	9/7/2015 16:27	1685	5	Thanks for your feedback.

Student51	Student101	1	"[firstname], My first suggestions would be if you haven't already consider narrowing your focus to a certain teacher group / technology. Say maybe a focus on on boar[lastname]g new TA's or instructors . The other suggestion I have is try the keywords observational learning if you think you need more research. I think your find some usefull articles that way. For example: http://prx.library.gatech.edu/login?url=https://search-ebscohost-com.prx.library.gatech.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=84691363&site=eds-live&scope=site"	9/7/2015 16:55	793	7	
Student51	Student29	1	"[firstname], it looks like your well on your way to a great project. Leveraging what you and your son have already learned along with MinecraftEdu seems like a perfect start for your goal. Beyond the curriculum you might consider what other resources/training a teacher might need to implement the curriculum. Can't wait to see your final product."	9/7/2015 17:09	655	6	"Great review, and very helpful feedback: ""Beyond the curriculum you might consider what other resources/training a teacher might need to implement the curriculum""."
Student51	Student18	2	"[firstname], it looks like you have done a good job on researching this topic and have a great area of focus for your project. I would agree that a lot of discussions in the course take a very US centric approach to educational technology.

Misc3	Student6	1	"1. I do not know of any. 2. I've done programming for my work for IP software. I stayed away from any outside resources and coded everything from scratch. The only software I used was commercially licenses that we paid for and made sure they would not own any of the IP or claim any profits. 3. I was thinking of something similar for my work, and i was going to give it back to work because its so niche I didn't know how many people outside of work would actually benefit from it. 4. The only thing i can say to that is how complete is the tool? If its not at the level you need then I'd suggest improving it first. 5. I think that's a good idea. I was exploring that as an option for some virtual training I wanted to create. And doing it via cloud seemed like a good idea."	9/7/2015 18:17	662

Misc3	Student46	1	"I would be interested in seeing what you come up with. I remember learning binary was a bit of a curve ball at first, but its still something I use to this day (and I don't work in the field of computers or circuit design). Did you think about the platform and if you wanted to use something like Unity to speed up your development? I know it can get complicated, and then fin[lastname]g the graphics for it too to make it look aesthetically pleasing can be a challenge. For resources i usually go here: http://[firstname]et.envato.com/. Don't know if you've seen that site before. But it has a subsite for graphics (graphic river) and one for pre-made code (code canyon). They may be useful to you."	9/7/2015 18:31	358		
Misc3	Student10	1	I really like your idea of fin[lastname]g useful sentences based on content that is currently out there. How does this differ from the Rosetta Stone model (I only use it as an example because I've heard its very effective). Or are you aiming for a different type of audience?	9/7/2015 18:37	245		
Student22	Student49	2	"Hi [firstname], I can appreciate many of the points made here: Adults have different priorities, forced to learn a new skill at times, the badges idea. I sometimes wonder if we work for the same company as it sounds like the same environment I am in; at any rate I am sure its a common problem in many companies/industries these days. A note on chunking - one issue I often see with chunking is that things are taught as separate chunks with nothing later on to tie them all together. This can lead to lots of disjointed information - what I think you need to show is some kind of round up where you can tie all the previous chunks together and show how it evolves into one cohesive system/topic so to speak. Hopefully that idea helps good luck!"	9/7/2015 18:40	1526		
Student22	Student65	2	"Hi [firstname], You certainly have given this much thought and a great number of tools have been described along with their pros and cons. This is a good approach as it shows you're trying to reap the benefits and avoid the shortcomings of each tool into your tool proposal. If I understand your proposal correctly I like the idea that students can see their skills buil[lastname]g over the course of the term instead of cramming everything in right before a test. In my view this helps build confidence and give you an idea how well students are actually progressing before the test happens, hence you may know who give individual help to earlier."	9/7/2015 19:05	503	6	
Student22	Student80	2	"Hi Student80, A very well written paper and likely the best I have seen so far, good job! You make some very good points, the ones that stood out to me are: 1. The freeloader and how to deal with it - things I see that happen is dissension in the group and avoidance of that person - lea[lastname]g to more freeloa[lastname]g. One way I saw to deal with that is to give everyone something specific to do so that they are part of the team and specific deadlines with periodic checkpoints - to identify when things are starting to go awry before it becomes a bigger problem. 2. Your note about students all sitting out the test to get the highest score was amazing - very clever! Never underestimate what a group of students will do with full cooperation - I wonder if you could not find other examples where if the whole group cooperates it benefits everyone. 3. I do not know if you can completely correlate human behavior to animals such as schools of fish or water striders, but I have to think that humans have some similar behaviors (i.e. follow the crowd) even if that behavior is wrong. (Think of the 1950's or 1960's experiment where subjects were given fake shocks and told to continue one - the very infamous experiment). I think you are well on the way to doing well."	9/8/2015 8:55	942	5	More anecdotal evidence of people experiencing freeloa[lastname]g. The comparison to Milgram is interesting.
Student22	Student48	1	"Hi [firstname], Very good points, I have heard some of these conversations on NPR as well Planet Money and This Am[firstname]an Life. I think it is insightful that you are looking into the disadvantaged student caught in the cycle. I think Distance Learning would be especially beneficial cost effective when teaching a subject for Gifted Students where you get a larger base of students from across a region (similar to Ga Tech KBAI with 400 students - around the world). A local expert may not have a large enough student base in a single school, but effective with a larger audience for more advanced or specialized courses. I would be interested in seeing your breakdown of the numbers where it is effective and not so effective."	9/8/2015 16:01	889		
Student76	Student43	1	"[firstname], this is a fascinating subject for all of us who have had really poor bar-ten[lastname]g experiences in the past. Just a few weeks ago I ordered a dry [firstname]i, and received something quite dirty with vodka and a large quantity of olive juice. Thus, I am wholly in favor of a system that can help train the inexperienced to become good bartenders. One thing I think that could have made your paper slightly better would be projection about how much a virtual system can take a new user. You state that mixology is more of a reference, yet it lists the quantities - how much further would your system extend this? I can foresee one issue being that VR cannot simulate [firstname]ght and flow mechanics. Much of an experienced bartender's expertise comes from expertise knowledge of these [firstname]ghts and pour amounts. Could you standardize your VR system to match a specific bar layout, thus creating a [lastname]sition between VR and reality? That said, I think your system would be value added. I love Unity 3D with the Occulus and think, that even with my slight critique, this system would be awesome to explore! Student76reene Student76"	9/7/2015 19:58	1170	6	
Student76	Student12	1	"[firstname], I mostly agree that traditional learning is not always optimal for student knowledge retention. I would like to see some sourcing in this paper, as I would like to see the research done on this subject. For example, several questions I have after rea[lastname]g this: 1) Are all subject matters poorly retained by usual classroom settings? 2) Why is this model still overwhelmingly used? 3) Which learning methodologies would be optimal for different domains (this would be important for your app) 4) How do you impart basic knowledge to unmotivated students (a.k.a. k-12)? It seems that the apps typically fall short of the classic model here. This is based of my extremely limited research into the domain. I look forward to seeing how your app fosters knowledge retention - as this is something I've always had a problem with (even to this day in board room meetings!).

Student76	Student100	2	"Great, candid feedback on your system. I agree with the critiques from last week that you are mostly repackaging something that already exists in the common domain. However, I see no problem with that. As you point out, most solutions are not available to the common domain. If this were a critique, Moodle would have never existed since there were at least two common products in it's domain (Blackboard, etc.)! You have demonstrated significant rigor in planning for your project. I can't help but wish you had identified the most significant foreseen roadblocks and made a little more distinction between your proposed product and Udacity. That said, those are better focus areas for next week's mini-proposal. Best of luck with your project! Student76reene Student76"	9/7/2015 21:50	395		
Student76	epennington3@gatech.edu	0	"Honestly, I do not think this paper met the goal of the week - it didn't show a deep dive into the subject it did not display much in the way of research (footnote or linking paper and tangible elements would be nice), and it did not identify the lea[lastname]g cognitive tutors. However, I do not believe it appropriate to grade this as not meeting my expectations, which I will clarify below. The proposed topic of metacognition could be amazing. However, it is amazingly COMPLEX, and if [firstname] thinks he can accomplish it (alongside taking one of the most time intense courses in the program), I want to encourage him as much as possible. Metacognition is a very tricky subject - humans do it rather poorly after eons of evolution - if we were able to prototype a metacognitive tutor systems, the applications would be fairly endless. We already use ""encourage"" tutoring systems to rely on our health (fitbit), time (classic watch), and social interactions.

[firstname]ly (no pun intended) - this peer review is much less helpful than in KBAI, for the simple reason that thread comments and questions are not sent to the peer reviewers' email.

Student61	epennington3@gatech.edu	2	"Very honest paper. I wonder how much the design of the cognitive agents will affect their ability to learn those concepts.

Student97	Student82	1	"Great research, it is very useful to make MOOC scalable. I am not sure if i understand your research correctly. Are you trying to make tools to completely remove human graders or tools to assist human graders? You mentioned two examples of AI algorithm for gra[lastname]g, are you trying to implement that algorithm in your tools or you are trying to improve it? I suggest you make your research problem more explicit and clear in your next assignment."	9/7/2015 21:12	517	4	"The intent of the assignment was to discuss current research, not necessarily to discuss which approach I will be taking.

Student85	Student73	1	"[firstname], I'm eager to see what you come up with in terms of data interface specs in the EdTech space - much of what can ultimately be done depends on standards being established and done well. A question for you about authentication: Does OAuth work in a federated Shibboleth environment and support multiple identity providers? For a single school like GA Tech this may not be a major issue; however, as soon as a second university joins the system it's something to reckon with. As a poten[firstname]l user of your application, I'll be glad to see it reach maturity. I'd be even more happy to see it sweep aside one or more of the existing applications. In particular you note Piazza as being weak on the API front - perhaps a new application that's better able to integrate with T-Square and Udacity could replace it?"	9/7/2015 22:26	20		
Student85	Student26	1	"[firstname], your idea of CSS and HTML validation does seem like a good place to start - at the front end, which is the beginning of a web site. I suppose broken link and content quality analysis play into your proposed application as well? Content is key - a site full of Lorem Ipsum has no value, even if it meets every web standard to perfection! Another question I have is how the middleware and backend of a web site/application might be evaluated? In addition to the problem of obtaining the code for verification, many development environments such as Ruby on Rails, PHP, .NET, and Java would have to be considered and determining quality of so many variations would be time-consuming. Finally, I was wondering about the proposed use of Selenium and how it might adapt to submissions from multiple project teams and/or [lastname]es to a previous submission? Good luck with your project!"	9/7/2015 22:26	22	6	"Very good points to consider. The question about browser code came up early on and and decided to start with pure HTML and CSS. We will also support URL submission so for our ini[firstname]l version server side code would need to be hosted externally, and then student would submit the url. We may or may not add that functionality at some point but it will definitely not happen during the time of this semester as there's quite a bit of variation there. I think out ""wish list"" would be to next add some JS evaluation modules; in terms of functionality we would like to have analytic services e.g. spot what type of issues students are struggling with and detecting patterns. -- running server side code is farther down the list."
Student85	Student35	0	"Excellent write-up, [firstname]! I agree that the plug-in architecture is essen[firstname]l to creating a usable product in this space because even the most concrete metrics - lines of code written, defects reported per lines of code, etc., are still ultimately governed by subjective valuation. For example, it is cold comfort to users of an application that unit test code coverage is in the 90+% range if the app does not fulfill its business purpose. Similarly, simple measurements such as lines of code written and commits made have been shown to be poor indicators of quality. I was wondering if part of your deliverable be a testing model for your application such that its results are compared against human evaluators? It seems to be that this is the ultimate criteria, that an automated evaluation system return results comparable to those that would be rendered by the instructor if he/she had sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate each project submitted. In the end, quality is an elusive standard, hence the value of a configurable architecture."	9/7/2015 22:26	1068		
Student85	Student34	1	"[firstname], this is an interesting approach to data collection! I am wondering, with the opt-in model, if (and how) you will compensate for the difference in results that all-volunteer participation will have as compared to mandatory, like-it-or-not participation? As you suggest, it will be very interesting to see the correlation between homework grades and exam grades. There's no such thing as a sure thing. but it seems a safe bet that those participating in peer feedback will outscore those who don't, even allowing for the bias (that I think will be) introduced by the opt-in participation method. Is this your expected result as well? Good luck!"	9/7/2015 22:44	520		
Student92	Student95	2	"[firstname], I think this is such an admirable project. I taught computer programming to high school students last summer. One of the most difficult parts of learning to code for the first time is the pure abstractness of code. I wanted to run the program again and use Arduino, but found, like you, that a lot of the parts required to make easy-to-program robots can be very expensive. I really hope that this is something that works out. I'd be curious about the effect of the cheapening of 3d printing technology and its effects on the prices of these items.

A really engaging game could extraor[lastname]arily helpful for those with Autism. I've played video games in the past that required some sort of social interaction as part of the game (I'm thinking those old Sierra adventure games like Space Quest I through V). They were really, really fun. I know that this game is probably much different, but it was similar in that you had to navigate the protagonist through series of tasks, many of which involved getting people to do what you want. I imagine a game that teaches appropriate behavior and is able to facilitate understan[lastname]g of social concepts in a safe, and progressive way would be amazing.

I'm glad that someone is paying attention to the needs of poor children, who probably need access to this type of software more than anyone. For the intelligent tutoring system research track, I am curious as to what applications have been effective in treating something like this. Out of curiousity, does something like listening to television (instead of actual adults with them) help, or does the language have be heard from humans (How much does the engagement of conversation make a difference compared to passive activity such as listening to the radio)."	9/13/2015 9:30	477		
Student26	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	1	Hello Mike. I'm a developer by day and I definitely agree it is very important to understand and listen to the stakeholders whenever buil[lastname]g a system because they ultimately determine the success of the system. That being said I wonder if having much interaction with stakeholders with respect to education technology would be difficult and that is why some choose not to follow the approach closely. I know from experience the more stakeholders you have involved the more fragmented the requests become as far as what they want the system to do. I'll be looking forward to seeing what you discover during your research.	9/8/2015 8:05	2342	7	I agree; but the fact it is difficult does not mean we should not do it.
Student26	Student35	1	"Hello [firstname], let me say for starters, it would be great to have a way to analyze team project contributions is a reliable manner. I am very intrigued by your project idea. That being said, I have found a couple aspects that really negatively affect my opinion about team work in academic environments: ""free-ri[lastname]g"" as you termed it, and bad group dynamics (some people just have huge personalities). The problem detecting free-ri[lastname]g is much of software engineering happens outside just co[lastname]g. For the evaluation system to work, ""non-code contributions"" should be accounted for also. Also, if you look at code and contributions, someone who checks in e.g. script files may seem to be doing a lot even if they had written 0 lines of code themselves. The other issue I've struggled with is teaming up with people where the group dynamic is awful and the whole environment discourages collaboration. I'm in a team like this right now and quite honestly considering withdrawing just because I feel my inputs are being ignored. I feel this type of dynamic will most definitely affect the contributions and efforts of the group and would also heavily influence any form of peer feedback. It's interesting though, so far I have not experienced these types of issues in the workplace (I've heard it many times how you need to learn to do teamwork at school, so you can do it in a workplace). I think in a workplace there's a financial factor that deters people from slacking at least to the same extent. Also in a workplace you don't have to worry about what effect someone else will have one your grade. I will be looking forward to seeing your solution, it will be really interesting."	9/8/2015 8:44	1368		
Student26	Student34	1	"Hello [firstname], I very much enjoyed rea[lastname]g your assignment. Your writing style is clear and well-organized and gave me a good idea of your planned research. I think you have chosen a worthwhile project as it is evident many students find CS 6505 very challenging and it is part of all specializations. It's important for students to be able to take this course and pass with high enough grades, otherwise it will become a huge bottleneck for all of OMSCS. Researching the influence of peer feedback and test performance is a good start. I think offering extra credit in ex[lastname]e for peer feedback will draw at least certain types of people: people who are worried about their performance and feel like they need extra credit - and - the very high-achieving students who complete all and every assignment possible. I'm sure other types of students will also participate but I would expect to see at least those. I'm pointing this out because it may be interesting and relevant for the purpose of examining the relationship to know what people's motivations are for participating in the peer feedback vs. choosing not to participate. From personal experience I've found that peer feedback is better suited for some classes rather than others; I'm yet to figure out what the exact criteria is. KBAI and Ed Tech, both gain a lot from peer feedback. I also tried it with computational photography, but I did not get that much out of it. It may be because the latter had co[lastname]g assignments but with peer feedback, we only saw outputs . Maybe based on your research you will also be able to identify factors that help make peer feedback useful and/or if the peer feedback experience needs to be modified somehow based on the course itself. Perhaps not related to the peer feedback experiment but for future research, I would also suggest you interview the students who performed really well and those who performed poorly or dropped the course, just to see if there are some common patterns in both of the extremes. It would be interesting to know how things such as workload, time commitment and preparation (prior math experience) come into play with respect to success in CS 6505."	9/10/2015 21:20	2339	7	[firstname] clearly gave it a lot of thought!
Student26	Student79	2	"Hello [firstname]. I enjoyed rea[lastname]g your assignment, in fact I read a post about your project earlier on piazza and responded to it -- it's me again :) First of all I must say I find your project very exciting as I'm closely familiar with foreign language learning. I especially think this statement from your assignment is spot on and would emphasize it in your implemented solution: ""Acquisition �Learning Hypothesis: language is best acquired through authentic natural communication instead of deliberate learning"". I emphasize it because to truly learn a language you need to hear it in real life, learn to pick up on the nuances embedded in language, and learn to express complex ideas and emotions in that language. That is of course beyond the scope of the reader, but should be the ultimate goal. I have a couple of suggestions for you, you may consider them now or perhaps at later revisions of the application: - try to incorporate spoken language; hearing the pronunciation is very important - this could be an option when highlighting a word to hear how it is pronounced - consider presenting text in a format it naturally appears in; e.g. newspaper articles / formatted as newspaper articles, street signs, posters/flyers etc. -- for a real challenge you could try something technical, like a legal document (evil laugh) - add texts that use the ""spoken"" version of the language; for some languages there's a huge difference between written/spoken text -- the idea here is to reach outside literature sources and get a feel for the verbal/informal usage. Some ideas here could be e.g. song lyrics, resume/CV, job posting, newspaper columns/ blog posts, [lastname]scribed speech, cartoon strips - also consider the possibilities of using music and video since that allows hearing the language 'as is'; one of my favorite methods of foreign language learning is listening to music and trying to figure out what it is about"	9/10/2015 21:59	2950	7	
Student9	Student28	1	"I'm definitely in favor of dropping the Single sign on stuff - not only is it a 'known' entity (as in, solutions exist) - most of the work may be related to educational bureaucracy. It also sounds like you know a LOT about that sort of thing already. Push toward the things you don't know as much about - even if it goes up in flames later - it will be more fun, and you'll get a lot more out of it. So onto your second idea - I've been researching game based learning, although I've been coming at it from a constructivist point of view - it sounds like you are interested in the behaviorist point of view. I think the next step is to find some theory, and catch up on the state of the art here. I'm new to education, but I think some starting point are Pavlov, and general behaviorism. Practice & repetition in education - these are all interesting starting points for your research. One of the best aspects of this line of philosophical thought (behaviorism), is it is much easier to measure student progress (time to completion, %correct). I'm following the constructivist school, and the biggest drawback is that it is VERY hard to measure learning. Good luck!"	9/8/2015 9:16	664	7	
Student9	Student41	1	"Sounds interesting. Since there have been a lot of synchronous tools (slack, hip chat) - have you considered an add on to one of those? One of the biggest drawbacks of many of these Q/A services (forums, answers boards) is actually fin[lastname]g / archiving past knowledge. Is there a way to have a new type of forum, where there is a published section, and almost a wiki-free for all - where SME's periodically clean things up? Just spitballing - I'm very interested in seeing where this goes."	9/8/2015 9:27	539		
Student9	Student97	1	"I'd start to think about MVP (minimum viable product). What is the smallest amount of work you can do to achieve the greatest result in this area? How will you create content? Is this a new learning platform, or new content utilizing an existing learning platform? It sounds like the tools that you need to build are the hacking 'playground' - everything else can be supported by existing infrastructure (udacity, etc)"	9/8/2015 9:36	227	6	
Student9	mdarden6@gatech.edu	1	"I think developing an 'out of the box' solution for teachers would be very helpful - maybe, if you are not a teacher yourself, partnering directly with a teacher to develop a curriculum would be useful?"	9/8/2015 9:40	133		
Student44	Student9	1	"I followed your research and logic. I also agree w/ you that: ""What is really needed is a systems and mechanics level analysis of games as educational tools."" What is missing for me is your next steps. i.e., Where are you going from here? Recommend you provide a ""NEXT STEPS"" section in your next submission. Right now I agree w/ everything you stated...but not sure where you are going next. W/o knowing where you are going next makes it hard for me to give you actionable feedback. Good job so far! Thanks."	9/8/2015 10:16	455	5	
Student44	Student50	2	"Very well articulated, organized and thought out. IMO you are track to develop a very good paper for this class. Regar[lastname]g your question: ""Do you think it�s viable to collect new research / survey data (specifically, from OMS students), or should I put that aside and focus on the described lit review and analysis of existing data?"" the answer is YES, it is viable to collect new research / survey data from OMS students. I business, much like research, you have to define to measure, measure to manage, and manage to control. If you think about it, those are the fundamental tenants of everything we do whether your managing your [firstname]ght or your budget. Given this concept, you would need to: 1. Identify and make contact w/ the individual(s) in the OMSCS program responsible for retention 2. Identify what measures the OMSCS program has defined, is collecting, and at what point in the process (i.e., beginning, middle or end) these metrics are collected 3. Once you know that, based on the knowledge you've acquired through your research, I'd expect you would be able to make sound recommendations for [lastname]es (i.e., add, delete, modify) to their data collection process. The real question is, are they willing to [lastname]e (i.e., modify their processes)? You'll have to make a compelling argument for [lastname]e, and based on what I've read already you have the ability to do that! Exciting work! Good luck."	9/9/2015 4:58	776		
Student44	Student20	1	"Clearly articulated and well written so far. Interesting topic as well. IMO, you've done a good job outlining the problem you want to focus on and have researched the available tools. The part that was missing for me is research/discussion into how middle and high school aged students think about and relate to the world. This is important knowledge you need if your going to design/select a solution that would help solve the problem. Good job so far!"	9/9/2015 5:11	332		
Student44	Student63	2	"Your research is very good. The flow and structure of this material is well organized. This material comes across as part of a larger body of work you are writing. Since I do not have access to your previous assignment, I cannot make any recommendations to improve the content of your paper. However, I can make three recommendations to help improve your writing style and structure of the material submitted in this assignment. 1. Do not use the first person ""I"" in your research paper. For example: ""In this assignment, I would like to discuss the challenge and possible solution for the intelligent tutoring system(ITS)(Conati, n.d.)."" could be rewritten as: ""This assignment defines ""student knowledge"" in the context of an ITS, outlines the challenges associated with student knowledge, and introduces two methods for addressing these challenges."" 2. Start a new paragraph with this sentence because it is introducing the second method. ""Another method to construct the student model..."" 3. Your writing style is a little choppy overall. I recommend you have someone proofread the complete body of work and smooth it out before you submit it. Good luck in your research!"	9/9/2015 5:16	2603		
Student8	Misc3	1	"That is something to definitely think about. I think in some ways it has been part of my problem with some classes not really being upfront with how they judge activity in places like Piazza. Just because someone doesn't post as often doesn't mean they are not as engaged. There have been plenty of times in other classes where I was checking to see if someone else experienced an issue similar to mine. if I would have posted anything, it would have been, Thanks I had this issue... and sure that might let people know its useful.... but that not posting that to me isn't the same as not being active. So something that can truly indicate if a student is participating and if they are in trouble could be useful. Although what I said seems to not be the directly what you want to do.. it seems like this is something that could be an extension."	9/8/2015 12:03	1207		
Student8	Student84	1	"I like your comparison to glassdoor. I did use that before intereviewing for my current Job. The downside to that is, glassdoor gave me a bad impression of my current company as where it gave me a much better impression of a different company. After just interviewing however, I felt like my views were switched. My current company just felt like a great place to work the moment I walked in. Granted it does have its issues but I've been given flexibility that I don't think I've ever had before. So this type of misinformation... although I don't know if you can call it that, is something you might want to look at. While I would need to look a lot more in depth to what you are doing to get a full graps, I do realize that the two can be slightly different. Having said that, I love the idea though. Too many people will look at random websites and they get so much bad information ( Autism caused by vaccines) that it can really have a negative impact. If we can find a way to chart development of children perhaps some parents, especially those with a lot of Anxiety about their children, can get a clearer picture of what they are up against should their child show some early struggles."	9/8/2015 12:23	1615	6	The misinformation concern I agree with. I like this feedback since it does add value and it makes me think.
Student8	Student95	1	"I think your subject reaches a general point of weakness. I had one 'shop' type class in my whole time in school. I would have loved to have a hands on type class where I could have done this kind of thing or maybe some other fun stuff. The only class I had was a class where I think the most advanced thing I did was create a car that was a moved by an air cartridge. Having said that, it was only for like half a semester and I never touched another thing like it since then. Having worked in Education, most of the 'shop' type classes seemed to be associated with lower educational students who needed some skills in life because they were not cut out for normal education. With that, I think if we could have more robot type things involved I think it would be awesome for a lot of people because I am confident that MANY people could do some very basic programming logic, even if its only using the block type programming. So I guess what I am saying is to some degree improving the level of robotics might come down to getting more robotics in schools such that the tools can be more required and then hopefully cheaper."	9/8/2015 12:50	748		
Student8	Student78	1	"In my work in telephony, we have software that is designed to look at tone and the idea is that if someone is basically angry... it might send someone straight to agent instead of putting them on hold. Perhaps that can be used as well. You could have a microphone on and when it hears you get upset, it can try and calm you down and help direct you. I have had times where in some games, I have been given a hint and sometimes I do jump straight to the hint after a short time. Having said that, there are times where more in depth answers to problems can sometimes give someone the insight needed to then solve more problems. For instance, in my Freshman math I had some problems where I could not solve the things, I just did not have the insight I really needed. However, after rea[lastname]g the solutions to a particular homework problem, I was then able to solve all like problems. So maybe there are some students who really need some real answers just to get them started and after that they can gain the insight they need. Normally the examples given in class should do this, but for me, it didn't often help."	9/8/2015 13:03	504		
Student1	Student86	1	"This is a good idea, but I suggest focusing more on going the visual route for teaching middle school age children. If you want to get them motivated to program there has to be something interesting for them to look at. Integrating co[lastname]g into math courses should be feasible, especially when students are learning basic geometry. Have you looked at any of the existing software platforms designed to teach co[lastname]g and see how they compare to your concepts?"	9/8/2015 12:26	396		
Student1	Student39	2	"This is a really good idea! Does Google Classroom have an on-premises version for schools with slow Internet access? And does it allow asynchronous loa[lastname]g of content on devices or does it require an always-on connection? My experience in teaching public school, Internet access is not always fast enough to be useful or it goes down frequently. There may need to be an offline mode that is still usable so if the connection is gone, there is still something the students can do. Just a suggestion."	9/8/2015 12:32	333		
Student1	Student53	1	"This is a really good concept. Have you thought about a way to test how technically adept a user is as part of the measurement, for example, how fast can they find elements on screen or click a mouse?"	9/8/2015 12:39	188		
Student1	Student15	1	"This is an interesting idea. If the process is to be autonomous, have you considered how your engine will rank content? Also, have you considered to prevent sites from gaming your system?"	9/8/2015 12:42	263		
Student17	Student40	1	"1. Can instructors benefit from an Integrated Faculty Website system vs. other options they have available to them (particularly, when compared to Course Management Systems such as Blackboard or Canvas, which are becoming much more commonplace and accessible as an option to all faculty members)? I think that this is highly dependent on the class. This is absolutely true for most cases, but I think that some classes will have a much greater benefit than others, especially depen[lastname]g on the professor teaching the course. 2. Do instructors need another attendance tool? I think that it would be a helpful tool, especially from a higher perspective. The data that it would provide would give an indication of which classes/professors create a stronger attendance than others. 3. Will there be drawbacks to developing this project? For example, maintenance and development risks if I were to leave the college in the future? I think as long as it is well documented and you have thorough support/buy-in the college would be able to continue its future maintenance. Of course, if there is poor documentation and the college determines it is more trouble than its worth, it could go unmaintained and eventually unused. 4. Does this project combo serve a useful EdTech function? Are there specific additional tools I might also want to look at inclu[lastname]g that could help fill one of the Pedagogical Needs (Project or Problem Based Learning perhaps)? This is certainly a use of educational technology an incorporating it into the classroom. 5. Does anyone have experience using a Faculty Website option at their institution (either one that was completely web-based, or one that made use of a desktop publishing program such as Contribute or Dreamweaver)? What kinds of thoughts or features did you like? Were there any that you disliked? 6. Any other thoughts or ideas? I think that you have a very interesting idea, but like many other ideas, it is heavily reliant on execution and how well it is built. Looking forward to seeing how your project progresses."	9/8/2015 15:04	1426	6	Thanks [firstname] for the feedback!
Student17	Student51	1	"Hi [firstname], I find your topic extremely intriguing, as it is a field that I have very little to no knowledge about. It is a great idea that you are actually incorporating your son in your project. I think that it will provide results that will be very interesting to analyze in regards to your topic. If you have access to it, I would recommend iMovie for piecing together and buil[lastname]g your video (I find it much easier than windows movie maker)."	9/8/2015 15:28	447		
Student17	Student101	1	"Hi [firstname], I think that you have a very strong topic. Many professors, especially of the older generation of learning have conflicts when it comes to using technology. It is unsurprising that many of these professors have not [lastname]ed their content or method of teaching over the years. However, with the introduction of many newer technologies, it would be highly favorable for them to become adept to using these technologies. This is a very difficult issue, but I think that you're on the right track and that you're asking the right questions. Looking forward to seeing how your project progresses."	9/8/2015 15:36	182	6	
Student17	Student29	1	"Hi [firstname], I think that your project idea is pretty awesome. Minecraft isn't just a game for children, but vastly used by those of all ages. Incorporating programming concepts and fundamentals would be extremely favorable. I think that you're certainly on the right path with your project, having researched similar existing programs. I am looking forward to see how your project progresses and what you come up with."	9/8/2015 15:39	239	5	
Student101	Student29	2	"This is a very impressive project. To be utilizing a game that is already popular with the targeted audience and to help them learn is great! Whether it is for programming or other subjects I feel that it would be make teaching much more easier. When I went to the MinecraftEdu site I did see they had a link to computercraftedu.com which teaches programming. Would your idea be something like that? Whichever, your project sounds awesome and wish you the best of luck!"	9/8/2015 15:56	2974	6	
Student101	Student18	1	"You have some very valid points. I agree that there are cultural differences between people from different areas of the world. I believe people need to be reminded that there is cultural diversity and need to be more open minded.

Student101	Student92	1	"Great idea. I agree it would be difficult to test a student's knowledge on the logic of programming. Perhaps that could be a project by itself? Some students may learn better by repetition, and I can see how that instruction method may be required. But maybe there are some other methods that could be incorporated in conjunction with the tests. For example, if one or several tests are failed it could direct the student to a particular method of instruction such as a repetitious method. If a different set of tests are failed a different method of instruction could be recommended or provided, and so on. Your project sounds promising and I am interested in seeing what you do. Good Luck!"	9/8/2015 19:09	1740		
Student2	Student22	1	"The paper's good, but a little more stream-of-consciousness style than I'm used to rea[lastname]g. I'll do my best to give accurate feedback but forgive me if some of it is off-point. 1. First off, interesting angle comparing middle school education with older adults. I think the educational approaches will be quite different, and that either realm could probably learn something from the other. That said, the factors affecting both the supply and demand of the two camps are quite different. I'll say that in my experience corporate education has been drastically, *drastically* inferior to what I receive in OMSCS or in my undergraduate. By corporate education, I'm referring to company produced training classes/videos. If, instead, you're referring to services such as Coursera and Udacity, I actually find that content to be superior. in my opinion, the quality of the instructor makes a bigger difference than delivery mechanism. 2. I like your points here. Particularly #2, ""saying someting very wrong can help one learn it right."" I personally find that to be true, and I think it's a ""silly"" approach that resonates with younger (e.g. middle school) students. That said, I'll be interested to see how/if you integrate these points into your project. 3. Somewhat similar to section 1. But, I think you should check your assumptions. I don't agree that the general student body prefers live training, in my experience (on campus and online) students would prefer on demand video lectures. Perhaps it'd be more accurate to say live training is preferred for labs/exercises? Likewise, make sure that the ""business end prefers video based"" in actuality. I'd argue that they prefer live but video based is often significantly cheaper. Look forward to seeing your project."	9/8/2015 20:43	798	6	"I think as [firstname] suggests some of his comments may be off-point and I think they are. What this tells me is that I was not as clear as I could be, so it is quite helpful as I believe he had the wrong idea. I also see that based on our individual experiences we are likely at different ends of the spectrum on some issues yet very much in sync on others."
Student2	Student13	1	"Well structured -- much appreciated from a peer review standpoint! Goal 1: Glad you've found a partner with whom to collaborate. It sounds like you've also established an appreciable professional network that will prove useful. In additional to poten[firstname]lly supplying information to you, I'm sure that if you were to share the results of your investigation with them you might pique interest elsewhere. You're clearly well suited for the project and it sounds like you have a good focus of what you'd like to do. Goal 2: Again, excellent progress towards your project. You seem to be many steps ahead of the average student, already having a (somewhat) refined goal and better yet material with which to work. I'd recommend carefully considering the ba[firstname] between utility and extensibility; a certain level of scope focus is required to produce useful results in analytics, but using too limited an approach can hamstring the impact and ability to generalize your fin[lastname]gs. Goal 3: Good meta-research on this front. It does seem that the discrete nature of much course data lends itself to a classification/clustering approach. That said, I wouldn't completely close your mind to the possibility of other approaches. I'd also suggest that what you're trying to find out should precede your determination of how you're going to find it! Overall it sounds like you're leagues ahead, [firstname]. Can't wait to see what you and [firstname] produce. Some of my full-time SDE work is in analytics -- particularly working with kNN variants. Happy to help in that realm if you ever need. I'm tentatively pursuing a project in the online education realm as well. [firstname] Student2"	9/8/2015 20:57	1625	7	Thanks so much for this feedback! Much appreciated!
Student2	Student7	1	"Cool project focus! I think a small percentage of the class projects will actually focus on generating course content. Because you're so well focused and succinct here I actually don't have too much to say. It sounds like you have a good understan[lastname]g of what is and isn't effective in these types of courses. Based on my experience I'd agree that interactive courses tend to be the most effective. But, there's an art to producing constructionist content like this. You need to strike a ba[firstname] between easy-mode online tools and setting up an intricate development environment on a target computer. Perhaps the latter's a little easier because you can focus on OS X, but it should be a consideration nonetheless. That, in my opinion, is the crux of success for courses like the one you're proposing. It may even be worth investigating that specific topic more. What, in your experience, is the right level of DIY versus online-editor-type-stuff in courses like this? In every aspect, carefully consider who you're targeting and what type of delivery is most suitable for them. Overall, it sounds like a great project and I hope you share when you're finished!

Student2	Student64	1	"[firstname], While your assignment focused mainly on one tool, I thought it was a good narrative that outlined a plan for your work. Nice job! InBloom does indeed sound like a useful and powerful tool. You're definitely right that perhaps it was ahead of its time, or simply over reached. It would be an ambitious (but awesome) project if you were to create a similar cloud based tool on a smaller scale. Certainly, I wouldn't try to enter the realm of big data -- for which there are many specialized tools to deal with the associated massive complexity. For reference, I think the current adage is that ""small data"" fits on the main memory of your computer (~32GB or less), ""data"" fits on your computer's HDD/SSD (several TB or less), and ""big data"" is too large to fit on a consumer HDD/SSD. I'm not sure if something like this exists, but creating an online dashboard that teachers can log into, view student data, and perform some sort of data driven activity would be a really neat project. If you're into it, it'd also be a great opportunity to dive into information security as well. Perhaps it could group enrolled students into levels of achievement, or highlight subjects certain students need to review. It could be done for online learning as well. For instance, on Udacity wouldn't it be cool if our professors could see which in-lecture quizzes students had trouble with, or which lectures students rewatched most? And make sure those areas are clear before the exam? Cool subject area, looking forward to your work! [firstname] Student2"	9/8/2015 23:01	722	7	Thanks for this great feedback. I will take it into consideration as I continue my work.
Student16	Student12	1	"Some interesting topics, but feels like the two areas don't connect. Real-time feedback apps (whether physical clickers, a mobile app, or even just classroom polling) can be useful, can also waste a lot of time. I've used them in classrooms and can be frustration when you tried to synchronize to content. Automatic assignment distribution based on knowledge acquisition would be the holy grail of some disciplines, but I'm skeptical as to whether it will happen without a very large and expensive knowledge-base to drive AI algorithms. What exactly do you plan to research/produce?"	9/8/2015 21:21	209	6

It teaches these kids vocational technology skills. It is an outstan[lastname]g idea that I think needs more traction. I wish you the best of luck in continuing your research on this topic."	9/9/2015 9:55	564	6	Interesting suggestion on the site. It may offer some requirements guidance regar[lastname]g the project.

Student72	Student53	2	"I really liked the idea of using the Google Analytics to track use of an application for both the reason you stated ""help them learn and better utilize the system"", but also for provi[lastname]g realtime feedback to application developers. I'm a software engineer myself and would love to get realtime data on how an application is being used which could help focus development efforts as well as highlight problems that need to be addressed ASAP. I don't have any experience with Google Analytics, but other Google APIs I have used have had a fairly short ramp-up phase before being productive with the tool. Good luck!"	9/9/2015 11:09	1145		
Student72	Student37	1	"Interesting idea. Sounds like something you would probably see at Google or Apple to generate new ideas or solve problems. I think it would totally depend on the company's workforce as to how effective it would be or the level of participation. You would probably need to include groups in the model which would allow for people with different backgrounds, experiences, etc. to come together to be creative. If fact, I would probably focus this on groups instead of individual innovators anyway."	9/9/2015 11:28	681		
Student72	Student1	1	"What I really wonder when comparing on-campus vs. on-line students is what other responsibilities they have in their life that could put demands on their time and energy. I would think that on-campus student would in general be younger which normally means less demands on them from home and work. Seems these factors could be playing a significant role in how students look at college, especially for adults going back to school after years away."	9/9/2015 11:40	1302	6	
Student72	Student39	1	"For the ""lab assistant"" idea I would think it would work best as a web application that provides functionality based on the user role (i.e. admin, teacher, student) as well as based on the device used to access the site. I understand the need to work with what teachers and students might have available to use (i.e. computer, phone), but would advise you to be careful not to limit the application's usefulness by targeting a small screen. Plus, I'm not convinced that low-income schools are even all that less equipped with computers and internet access than schools in higher income areas of a city. That comes from personal experience of sen[lastname]g my children to a title-I school in Atlanta. Maybe more research is needed. :)"	9/9/2015 12:02	671		
Student60	Student26	2	"Hi [firstname], The idea for project seems promising. You idea seems to be defined well, and I think this will be interesting project. Though I believe that there will be a lot of scena[lastname] you would need to cover and and well defined scope of the project will be a life savor. And, I hope you have a wonderful team to work with. All the best."	9/9/2015 13:13	1303	6	"There are definitely lots of scena[lastname]. We will start by putting the core functionality in place, i.e. assume HTML/CSS page(s) and give instructor the ability to define how it gets evaluated and then run the test; Once that is in palce we can expand out to other services and features."
Student60	Student21	1	"Hi [firstname], The problem you specified is a good one and is needed in OMSCS platform. I think your challenge will be to capture the information from existing students in a well formulated data structure so that we avoid duplicates. Consider wikipedia; when we search for a topic, we just get one and only one article with links to other articles. This is par[firstname]lly possible because of intelligent system of wikipedia + some dedicated people to maintain this. The challenge for you is everything has to be automated. One way would be to just have limited number of topics and force users to edit the wiki and not add a new topic. There are other challenges as well, but I think this is important one. All the best."	9/9/2015 13:34	1266		
Student60	Student85	1	"Hi [firstname], You have a very well researched topic for project. I found this topic interesting. As you said there is definitely well defined path for development. It would be interesting to see how your product stands out compared some some already existing tool which provides a way to capture curricula. Also it would be interesting to see how there is an inter connection (if any) between curriculum (e.g class 5th's math curriculum is built upon class 4th math etc.)"	9/9/2015 13:56	3200	6	The point about inter-connectedness of grade levels is interesting and important!
Student60	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], I really liked your idea. In fact I has similar idea for a mobile dashboard. I later decided to take up another problem. Anyway, for this specific problem for which you wish to solve, the major problem as you stated is lack of inter-operability / lack of APIs. In that case, you will have to mainly rely on web scrapping. The problem with that is your application will break if there is a [lastname]e in the web page design. Nevertheless that is less frequently to happen. All the best for your project."	9/9/2015 14:49	554		
Student58	Student38	1	"Good thoughtful analysis. You should definitely reach out and try to find more information about GPlag. Since your goal is to have the system incorporated into the autograder, why is having a local system so important?"	9/9/2015 17:52	259	6	This makes me realize I need to explain further the reasons that a local system would be beneficial.

Student58	Student25	1	"Fin[lastname]g a way to alleviate ""Will it run?"" fears from CS students will probably add years to their lives. There does seem to be a move towards making this easier for students, at least in the OMSCS. The high performance computing just gives you a VM image with the source code you'll be working with pre-installed. It left me with much more time to focus on learning the underlying materials rather than worrying about compatibility. I would think it makes life easier for graders as well. Given the ease of simply having everyone use a VM, I wonder why many classes don't make use. Have you found much regar[lastname]g the reasons why educational organizations aren't doing so?"	9/11/2015 11:42	499	6	
Student58	Student96	1	Ongoing professional education is very important and I haven't seen much discussion about it on the class forums. I was on a training committee for a previous employer and there were a number of challenges. Not every employee is interested in upgra[lastname]g their skills so encouraging engagement is tricky. Fin[lastname]g a ba[firstname] between increasing the accessibility of your training program and minimizing workflow interuptions isn't easy. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.	9/11/2015 11:51	954	6	
Student66	Student73	1	"I like that you have identified that Clever startup as a good proof of concept for your idea. Honestly, if you were able to show a successful tool for tracking course/program progress in the OMSCS and you could demonstrate its benefits, you would definitely be able to get buy-in from Georgia Tech. I don't know whether you plan to make this into a startup but there is poten[firstname]l if you start with a small, successful tool for a particular use case and then demonstrate how you could expand it outwards. Good luck on your project!"	9/9/2015 15:59	8448		
Student66	Student85	1	"Very compelling project, while I never bought into the idea of different learning styles, there is no doubt that a tool to help teachers identify struggling students has a great deal of poten[firstname]l. Your single sign-on idea is spot-on. My high school utilized a lot of different software technologies but I barely recognized they were even different tools because of their single sign-on system. I think it was a great idea to talk to teachers about this because, as I recall, we had a website to see what homework was due the next day. It ended up getting completely replaced after my sophomore year of high school because all of the teachers hated it. It seems like, at the end of the day, the cost to the school district and the teacher reviews will be what determine its success. If you can get in touch with those teachers again, it is definitely worth asking what they like and dislike about all of these different tools that get thrown their way. Good luck!"	9/9/2015 18:21	1152	6	"The administrators buy the system, but it's the teachers who use it most and are helped - or hindered - most by it."
Student66	Student21	1	"This is a good idea and definitely has need within the OMSCS community (I have a couple of book[firstname]s to some of those student-run pages you mentioned myself). While I think studying what makes those student-run pages successful is a good start to help you understand how to serve the target audience successfully, I think you would gain a lot of knowledge by looking at other successful projects designed to bring someone up to speed on a particular topic. This topic is not just limited to online class preparation. It also comes in to play in a variety of other settings, such as on-boar[lastname]g a new employee at a company. There may be some best practices across the industry that you could incorporate into your project. Good luck!"	9/10/2015 16:34	672		
Student66	Student60	1	"Cool project, you could really take this project a lot of different ways based on how you want to do group formation (personality, project interests, etc.). I also think that study groups in online classes are a great idea although I think they are better-suited for classes which require more commitment like the OMSCS than more traditional MOOCs like Coursera. I definitely agree that teachers should form the groups as opposed to the students for a variety of reasons but requiring the teachers to do so may hurt the likelihood of them enjoying your tool (particularly if there are a ton of students in the class). Perhaps you could make that a configurable option? Something I wished had been in this class was a more centralized location where people could post projects and I could indicate interest so your project really hit home for me as something that I wished had existed in this class. I think that doing the ""Forming"" stage really well would be better than trying to tackle Forming, Storming, and Norming all in one semester. You'll have to talk that over with your mentor though. Best of luck with your project!"	9/10/2015 19:06	1042	7	The feedback provides a nice analysis of third person understan[lastname]g.

Student94	Student2	1	Interesting topic . Would the questions on the mobile device be exhaustive of the topic discussed or it will only address some of the issues discussed. If it will address only some how do you determine which ones make the cut.	9/9/2015 18:21	1103		
Student94	Student13	1	I enjoyed learning about the goals you set and how you accomplished those goals. It seems research usually requires [lastname]es over a period until the actual problem is finally set. I would love see where this ends based on the timeline and resources available.	9/9/2015 18:39	754	7	Thanks so much for your feedback. Excited to be on the right track!

Student79	Student45	1	"It seems you have a reasonable plan. My ini[firstname]l thoughts are how will this be distinguished from the 100's of tutorials on each of those subjects (git, linear algebra, java, python, etc.). Maybe these tutorials are simply customized for the GT OMSCS students and courses. I recommend planning out and looking at comparative courses to ensure your contribution is not just more of the same."	9/9/2015 18:43	320	6	"Great point, that is one of the major goals. To keep it to the point for OMSCS students only"
Student79	Student19	1	"I really like your motivation for this project. I think when our children grow up nearly every profession will benefit from being able to program -- unless the AI agents do it all for us :) I really like the 'social networking' aspect. What you are really looking at is similar to a MMO or probably something like Minecraft. You may even want to consider doing some addition to Minecraft to make it more accessible to ""programming"". But this also comes with some big challenges. Whenever you have an online game, it is difficult to control trolls who have fun destroying the experience for others. Preventing trolls requires significant resources/programming. Good luck. I'd like to check out the results."	9/9/2015 18:49	463	7	
Student79	Student71	0	"I'm sorry, but this paper was quite confusing. Mentioning various choices seemed not relevant to this assignment (just discuss the project you are going to work on). There is no description of soft-skills which makes it difficult to understand exactly what the goal of the project will be. The problems discussed did not seem immediately evident. Do you know this from personal experience? Research? On the plus side, it is a great goal to help disadvantaged youth."	9/12/2015 19:51	492	5	"Not sure what wasn't clear to the reviewer. Had very good feedback from other reviewers. Perhaps my overview of previous papers wasn't detailed enough. My presumption was that readers are aware of what ""soft skills"" are, but probably could've included that as part of a summary overview."
Student79	mkhalil33@gatech.edu	2	"I really like your premise about getting the heart of EdTech products and making sure that they improve technology. I think part of the investigation needs to examine the political/systematic incentives that cause school districts to approve certain technology. It would be great to see some recommendations to districts that would prevent this. Maybe some exploration of certification for development processes? Having seen and read some, I think a lot of the problem is the hype and personal/political motivations of individuals to been seen as progressive. And EdTech companies can get wrapped up in their own hype and desire to improve education. But they also have a bottom line and salesmen must sell to make a living. There also seems a bias to discount traditional methods of education instead of a reasoned/evidence-based evaluation."	9/12/2015 19:59	775

Student43	Student58	1	"I definitely see the value in doing this research. I do wonder though, whenever I read about retention, if it's possible to be too narrowly focused on retention itself? For instance, I might sign up for a class b/c I feel there is some needed information I can gain from the class. But if I find that information within the first couple of lectures, I could easily foresee that I may not then complete the rest of the course. Should this then be viewed as a failure of the course or a high satisfaction rating on my part b/c I quickly found and gained the specific knowledge I was looking for. Also, I'd make a distinction between retention of one-off courses vs those tied to a certificate or degree program like OMSCS where I have to finish the courses to earn that final creden[firstname]l. I think there is at least one other student interested in retention, not sure if you've connected with them.

Student43	Student96	1	"I figured out that your site is invisiblegold.com and did a quick looking through it. You mention Invisible Gold in your title but I think you should explicitly direct your reader to your site. I now have a better idea of what you're presenting, others may not be as curious and find your site on their own. I'm not sure if you've seen a number in your rea[lastname]gs, but it seems to me you have to have some number of active users for that community to form. A couple things I'd consider: - ease and quickness of use. I've always used the metrics of number of clicks required to do something, too many clicks and people won't use it. - can you designate some of your current users as ""experts"" and encourage them to moderate the site and add their own content. - I see you have online workshops, but do you ever sponsor user meetings in person (not sure if that is feasible)"	9/9/2015 21:56	1010	6	
Student43	Student38	1	"I think this is a very interesting subject and I had never heard of the water[firstname]ing method but I find that really cool. I would definitely recommend contacting the GPlag authors to see if you can get access to their source (I did a quick search and couldn't find either). I noticed on the Moss site that someone had build a Windows GUI wrapping the service, not sure if you looked at it. Given what is apparently available, maybe your best approach would be to build a similar web interface around Moss, perhaps something that could be tied into T-Square? Related to this, but out of your current scope, I've been wondering if there would be a way to force implementation details for a given assignment that would make it difficult and infeasible to copy someone else's implementation. For instance, auto-generation of ""personalized"" unit tests specific to each student that must pass as part of the assignment. In other words, prevention rather than detection of plagiarism."	9/9/2015 22:13	2287	7	Really helpful and insightful - made me think and he clearly thought about my paper.
Student71	Student40	2	"One thing that I think would benefit this greatly, and maybe you've done this and I missed it, but the first two questions on page 5 is something you may want to ask your user community. The instructors may be able to give you some ideas of what works, doesn't work, and what would be nice to have. I also think you can probably resolve reporting problems (vertical vs. horizontal, etc...) by manipulating CSV or other report files output from the software with another program. For example, you could have a home grown report UI where the instructor could select some reporting options that would manipulate and build pivot tables for them. Example: a threshold option where maybe the instructor wants to see all students with more than 3 absences."	9/10/2015 1:58	2202	6	"Thanks for the additional ideas [firstname]! The extra reporting options are exactly what seems to be missing from the commercial options (which you would think is a bit surprising, considering they probably hear the same feedback I do from Instructors about their software, and features that would be useful to include)."
Student71	Student17	1	I agree that giving a student a laptop is not EdTech. I think the idea of BYOD (bring your own device) and having apps that are engaging available for those devices is on the right track.	9/10/2015 2:35	843

Student71	Student19	1	"Very cool idea. I don't have much input on buil[lastname]g games as I'm not well versed in that arena, however it might be interesting to include some historical facts, perhaps in some sort of popup or bubble (maybe with the ability to turn off the feature if desired), about the history of computer science.

Is there a similar development boom? I am sure there are similar ""Top 10 Apps of X"" for any industry these days. What is the goal of this research? To hep college students dig through the mountain of apps? Or, to help app designers in this field create more user-friendly college apps? Or both!?

Create a more interactive way to better solve #1. There are numerous studies on getting STEM more interest; particular for grade-school girls. Have you thought about gender-based interest? In terms of a next steps / research / solution, this is not clear. What is your goal of this project? To create your own product / patent that will poten[firstname]lly be better than the rest? Or analyze those that are the ""best"" and offer recommendations on improving those products to better acclimate MS & HS students? P.S. My email is l[lastname]@gatech.edu.

We are all obviously Dedicated Learners and may agree with some or all of the issues you raised. I remember being pushed ""to-the-brink"" when I first started this journey. It would be beneficial to conduct informal surveys with GT OMSCS students for your data? As other Ed Tech students are progressing on this capstone project, they are likely in the same position as you are: Keep researching or start analyzing. For me, my strategy at this time is to pick 6-8 decent case studies and thoroughly review them. Later, in my paper, I will only site about 4 of them."	9/12/2015 15:25	1141

Heavy utilization of probability appears to be key in order to determine the best differen[firstname]ted learning path for the student. On a side note, it may not be entirely relevant but, K-12 Am[firstname]an education is heavily moving towards tailoring education to the Individual Learner; instead of the traditional setting where the same student takes the same test as his neighbor. This is the primary motivation behind integrating mobile technology in the classroom (i.e,. every student having their own iPad).

Student18	Student42	1	Hi Nick Your project idea is really great. I remember rea[lastname]g one article in the media on the study you mentioned. At that time I was not very much convinced. After rea[lastname]g your assignment I am planning to do more rea[lastname]g on this research. From the project ideas you mentioned I think intelligent tutoring system will be more practical.	9/10/2015 7:39	2006		
Student18	Student92	1	Hi [firstname] I like your idea of teaching programming and language learning. I also agree with you that the biggest challenge here is to measure student knowledge in the domain. I find some similarity in your idea and my experience with Khan Academy. I remember Khan Academy platform used to reassess my Math concepts by mixing some old problems with new ones. If I fail on some already learned Math concept it automatically [lastname]es my learning path by giving me more problems and examples from that area before I move on.	9/10/2015 8:13	2056		
Student18	Student75	1	Hi [firstname] I really like your idea. If such a system is in production it will be really helpful for OMSCS administrators to forecast student course demands.	9/10/2015 9:07	1574	4	Thanks.
Student18	Student55	2	"Hi [firstname] I have read your assignment and found your work very well researched and very detailed. Your area of interest is very different than mine and I cannot find anything that came in my search that will be helpful to you. May be that is the problem with peer feedback in this course. We are moving in so many different directions that when we read others work we get inspired but find very little to add value. Anyway, your idea for advising technology is really great! One idea that comes to mind is that your system could ask the OMSCS students about their desired area of specialization. The system could then ask the student to fill the questionnaire about relative strengths and weaknesses in various concepts, preferences, available hours or (if possible) could use student past scores. Then the system could use this data to create an outline for his/her degree program. The system could also suggest that it would be better to take certain courses before other courses. Or it could also suggest that before taking certain advance courses student needs to brush-up skills in following areas."	9/12/2015 7:51	250

The piazza thread was about participation in online courses. Here's a part of my response: That said, the OMCS participation is quite something. I actually am concurrently taking online courses (statistics) in another program, and the piazza boards there are nearly silent. I wonder why that is? There is mandatory participation there, as well. It could simply that integrals provide less fuel for conversation...? Anyway, do you consider computer science a STEM field? Because I'd venture that there's plenty of participation here! But I'd agree with you that there's almost none in a math class. Sounds like a novel and worthwhile idea! Good luck!"	9/11/2015 0:30	227		
Student56	Student81	1	Interesting idea. Here's an interesting angle to explore in your paper: do you feel that the OMCS program is lacking because the students cannot be 'seen'? What impact do you think it might have on the program if your technologies would be implemented?	9/11/2015 0:33	335	4	
Student95	Student36	1	"This is a bold ini[firstname]tive to take on piazza and stack overflow! Actually I do like where you are going with this. I think it is important to review and analyze tools that connect students to teachers, groups and other students. It is difficult to make a system that would be great for everyone involved. My suggestion, if you plan on writing myOLE is to start with some base framework like PHPBB, Drupal or even Wordpress. It would be beneficial to leverage those codebases to make what you want,"	9/10/2015 9:38	488	6	
Student95	Student78	1	"This sounds like an excellent area to explore. With on-line tutoring and classes becoming more and more common, it is difficult for the teachers to figure out if a student ""gets it"". I like the idea of eye movement following. On another (possibly unrelated) note, my biggest challenge with computer based instruction is losing focus. Often times I will be watching some OMSCS video only to realize my mind is wandering. Or I am constantly fighting the urge to check reddit. How can the online system better keep my attention? This would lead to better understan[lastname]g and retention.

Student95	Student84	2	"Very interesting. Child development is a difficult and complex field. I am a middleschool teacher and have studied human development in several classes and it did not prepare me for having my own children. Parents are acutely aware of milestones and would find your system quite useful. Especially if there were specific recommendations as to what to do if milestones were not being met. Another thing you might want to consider is your baby reflexes play into milestones. If babies do not develop the reflexes they are supposed to it can lead to learning differences and diagnoses like ADD, etc. There is a whole field of childhood physical therapy dedicated to reflexes! Fascinating. Good luck with your project."	9/10/2015 9:53	746		
Student95	Misc3	2	I have not really done much with learning analytics but it sounds like a fascinating field. It sounds like it will be helpful in predicting student outcomes.

Student37	Student15	2	Seems like a very well thought out plan for buil[lastname]g this system. I think the trickiest part of this is defining your tags- how do you completely capture the activity in a bundle of tags/words? It can be hard to identify this in a learning context	9/10/2015 12:39	166		
Student37	Student1	2	"Good research! I'm going to go ahead and predict that the number one reason why dropout rates are higher in online courses is entirely social, between the classmates and themselves, and the lack of ""shame"" you might feel dropping out from a class run by a faceless professor with faceless peers."	9/10/2015 12:41	136	6	
Student37	Student39	1	"You might want to look into buil[lastname]g WebRTC into a web app to accomplish your goals. Inside a webpage you should be able to, hypothetically, capture all the usefulness of google classroom (by enabling teachers to coor[lastname]ate setup things etc) and then present content to the students while enabling interactive sessions via webRTC. All this would require is a device with a web browser."	9/10/2015 12:45	151		
Student37	Student53	2	"Good idea inclu[lastname]g the first 2 assignments, makes sense for peer review where we get different people each time. I think a theoretical solution is appropriate (as a research project) in this class, where your deliverable is research not the actual tool. Under that context, you could deliver a package at the end of the semester stating your fin[lastname]gs on what would be effective ways to both detect user adoption capability and improve it. One (fun) idea that springs to mind rea[lastname]g this is that you could have a camera/microphone listen for key actions/phrases that would indicate how the user is adopting to the new tool. EG: you see a person flustered and slamming their hand into the keyboard, they need help. You hear them say something like ""WHERE THE HECK IS so and so function"" and the application could just spell it out."	9/10/2015 12:47	336		
Student12	Student38	1	"This is an interesting idea especially since aI never think about code being plagiarized. None of my CS undergrad courses have ever discussed this(unlike English). Im curious if there's even a standard ritual for citing code that you've copied. And I wonder how you can take into affect ""obvious code"" such as iterating over an array. Moving on from my cu[lastname]ity, asking the authors for the software is completely up to you. But I think an interesting analogy if you compare the two(or more if you find) software to compare peaks and valleys when examining code."	9/10/2015 14:22	873	6	helpful to hear another view; appreciate this feedback.
Student12	Student43	1	"I've always wanted to learn how to be a bartender. Not to make money, I just like the flips, spin, and tricks they do with the bottles. I like the idea of the virtual reality where you can actually simulate a bar. It's a great way to see where a bartender's skills are and how face they can advance. There''s not enough time in this course but it would be intriguing to use the VR Bar as an experiment for choosing poten[firstname]l bartenders and record the success/failure rate. Also, it would be a fun game!"	9/10/2015 14:36	650	6	
Student12	Student58	1	"I have taken an online course(maybe 2) and have not completed it so I am definitely part of this group. However, I was active in the forums but still did not manage to complete the course. The actual course and participation in the forum dwindled around the same rate. I definitely struggle with the ""do it at your own pace"" classes(where you can complete the class in an infinite amount of time). I think another issue with the online completion rates is the fact that students can view the lectures at any time. But in traditional classes, you have to be at the lecture at class time or you miss it. And with online classes you delay the lectures, then when the test comes you've missed multiple lectures and it produces a snowball affect."	9/10/2015 14:47	788		
Student12	Student96	1	"This is a great idea. As someone who works in web designs. I'm constantly stretching myself in many directions learning about the newest technologies and standards. I can spend all day searching one topic and effectively implementing it. It's a daunting and exhausting ritual. Having a central location for discussions and knowing that you'll get feedback instead of copying and pasting the same question/discussion in many forums(I've seen this many times). I do agree that the biggest caveat is having developers committed to the forum(which relies on individual contributors)> I'm not sure but there has to be something that engages the posters to remain committed and actually contribute. Personally, what stops me from contributing on forums and stack overflow is that I have to make an account. I don't want to create an account and I have more passwords than I can remember. I just want to post my question. If it's anonymous that's fine. But if you want to have an account fantastic!"	9/10/2015 15:00	652	7	
Student39	Student53	1	Excellent read - I like the idea of adapting towards users based on performance and giving feedback based on that.	9/10/2015 19:29	312		
Student39	Student15	1	I like the idea. I had to implement a tagging system for work for individual users rather than content. Eventually the manager wanted dynamic tagging and have the system assign tags based on criteria. It will be interesting to see what you end up with!	9/10/2015 19:29	638		
Student39	Student86	1	"i like you recognized scope awareness and took a step back, it will definitely allow you to zero in on your topic. I liked how you broke down the different types of paths you could research in terms of content.

Student39	Student52	1	Definitely interesting. I would be curious to the effect of an ITS on younger individuals vs older ones.	9/10/2015 19:44	136	6	
Student53	Student5	1	"Hi [firstname], In regards to the first idea, the one about the community, I would lean more towards this being a mashup of all the information on google+, survey's, etc. The key here will be to have a very innovative UI/UX design that makes people go to your community rather than just doing a search in google+. The second idea, I think it is simpler, but more likely to succeed, a degree planning tool would definitely be cool, I have a spreadsheet where I am keeping track of my courses, I can envision using something else instead. If you take this route I would suggest contacting our academic advisors Mimi and Rebecca to get their feedback, this might be something helpful for them as well."	9/10/2015 21:20	1347		
Student53	Student15	2	"Hi [firstname], this looks great! This is very well explained, concise and very clear. You present the existing solutions, their limitation and propose a solution based on that. I like the premise of this idea, it provides for opportunities for new content that is valuable to also be relevant. Nowadays if something is new but similar to other stuff then it tends to have a hard time catching up with other resources that already have an engagement history. Good work! I look forward to how this evolves."	9/10/2015 22:04	1287		
Student53	Student86	1	"Hi [firstname], I think each of the 3 syllabus have their own positive side. 2.3 sounds like a good idea but for younger kids, maybe 6-10. Out of the 3 the one that caught must my attention was 2.2. Programming a lot of times centers around doing something you don't want to do in a repetitive manner. Teaching students to program to automate something they learned, will teach them how to program and teach them a lesson about its value as well. Furthermore, doing this for Math can enhance a student's understan[lastname]g of Math which by itself is very important. As feedback to your research I would wonder what is being done right now, at what ages are kids introduced to computers and programming and how. Good luck!"	9/10/2015 22:26	1831		
Student53	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname], The introduction with bullets on the previous assignments was a good idea. This topic is definitely something that can further be advanced. You seem to have a good set of sources to rely on. My only feedback for future assignments would be to get more specific on what part of the ITS you want to improve."	9/10/2015 23:38	15	6	
Student52	Student5	1	"Hi [firstname], What a great and interesting topic to choose for this class. I was very close to considering something very comparable earlier in the class when looking into research topics. One of the struggles I faced, along with many others in the OMSCS program as you mentioned, is knowing how to prepare for an upcoming class. For instance, my first semester I enrolled into Computer Networks and Advanced Operating Systems. Computer Networks was not too difficult to adapt to because I was familiar with the Python programming language and many of the concepts in the class already. Advanced Operating Systems was a completely different scenario because of how heavy it was in the C programming language which I had never used, eventually lea[lastname]g to me dropping the class. I think scena[lastname] like this may be better avoided through the research and project that you are proposing which will, hopefully, save time and money for students enrolling into OMSCS. I�m interested in what metrics you plan to collect to help students gauge what classes they should enroll. I see the list of sub-components you provided, but do you plan to list specific examples as well such as those some classes already provide as a prerequisite quiz? AOS- http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf Computer Networks- http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks/ Overall, great proposal and very exciting considering the impact it will have for current and future OMSCS students."	9/10/2015 22:01	991		
Student52	Student54	1	"Hi [firstname], Great write-up on the topic of academic integrity. This is a unique topic, as I have not read anything similar in my other peer reviews yet, so kudos to you for looking at this project from a different standpoint than most. I agree with your statement about cheating lea[lastname]g to disastrous results when [lastname]sitioning into the workforce. I haven�t studied in this area, but it seems logical that cheating through school would only lead to a life of cutting-corners and cheating, especially in the workforce. As soon as an employer catches on to the scheme, they�re out the door. There won�t be a slap on the hand to say �Don�t do that!�. It sounds like you have some interesting ideas towards developing better deterrents for academic integrity that aren�t necessarily technical-related. I think that approach could certainly help. You mentioned having the human element to verify infractions and I wondered what it would take to [lastname]sfer that additional burden from the instructor to the student so that they have to defend any infractions that are detected instead. I see flaws in that design though because students could then modify their work �just enough� to pass the checks again though. Do you still plan to look at this issue from a technical standpoint as well? Great topic and I hope to hear how you lead this project!"	9/11/2015 18:59	718		
Student52	Student47	1	"Hi [lastname], You have a very interesting research topic! It seems like this topic could be fairly broad when trying to focus on a particular problem. The �Good Behavior Game� is a not a concept I�ve read or heard about before but sounds like a good place to start in researching this topic. One of the main issues I could see with attempting to use technology to help with classroom behavior is whether the teacher�s administrative staff will support them and these endeavors. Often times, I�ve heard about teachers using the school disciplinary policies but that the administrator staff are too lax and do not fully support their teachers. I did some quick searching using Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search to see if I could help find some topics, but some of the results seemed much older. Hopefully the research that you conduct through this class will help greatly contribute to this field. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22classroom+behavior%22+%2Btechnology&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11&search_plus_one=form http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Search?query=classroom%20behavior%20technology"	9/11/2015 19:26	100		
Student52	Student94	1	"Great topic choice! I�m researching ITS as well but focusing more on the data collection models used to parse the data and provide more accurate results. I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your paper about Montessori. It�s not a topic that I have heard about before. I�m certainly more interested now after rea[lastname]g about it and as a new parent as well. I may look into this more for my own children. :-) Have you considered using devices like the Microsoft HoloLens as a technology platform to adopt some of the Montessori tools? You mentioned fin[lastname]g ways to bring Montessori tools to a digital platform like click and drag, but imagine giving students the same set of tools in a virtual sense so (almost) everything is the same in concept, minus the actual physical tool. Technology like this could poten[firstname]lly help lead the Montessori approach further in advancement by ad[lastname]g a whole new element to the teaching approach and tool sets used. Children could greatly go beyond the normal creative realm by using HoloLens to quickly design, discover, and explore new topics and tools. Not that it directly applies to your specific path of research, but I would be interested to know how the working time in classrooms differ between the two models, such as how well do students typically perform with either longer or shorter working times. From my perspective, I would prefer to have larger periods of time to work on projects in my workplace so that I can dedicate more quality time towards completing the project. With constant disruptions, say every 45 minutes like the traditional class model, it becomes difficult to complete one project. On the other hand, juggling many projects at once can help develop prioritization skills, or cause stress. ;-) The chart in your paper made me think about how those working time schedules would [lastname]slate to the workforce and could one model over the other be more effective for preparing the next generation for their careers. I hope I get to hear more about your research throughout the course!"	9/11/2015 21:14	14		
Student64	Student22	1	"Jim, you have some very neat ideas listed. I look forward to seeing which one you decide to go with for your mini proposal."	9/10/2015 23:56	1935

Student64	Student48	1	"This is a great topic. I wonder how institutions that charge a higher tuition that is justifiable based on a high ranking would be affected by a system such as this that levels the educational playing field, so to speak. I look forward to seeing what you come up with."	9/11/2015 0:33	725	6	
Student64	Student80	1	Interesting idea on analysis of peer feedback and its effectiveness.	9/11/2015 17:03	2576	2	this feedback is approximately content-free.
Student87	Student93	2	"You have a very ambitious idea. Modeling the individual's behavior via an MDP from Machine Learning methods in Natural Language Processing requires a lot of moving parts. I liked how you were able to lay out all of the moving parts of your idea and you seem to have a good grasp on the level of depth that will be needed. Have you begun to narrow down what topic in this problem you will focus on? And I am wondering what you think about the theory that if you create the system to alert narcoleptic individuals that they are dozing off, will that be enough to actually wake them up? It seems like you are off to a great start here nonetheless. I think it'll be very interesting to see what you come up with."	9/11/2015 9:06	1192	6	I admit it is ambitious --- and it seems that more peers are identifying it
Student87	Student81	1	"This is interesting because I am also doing an augmented reality based project using Oculus Rift. I think what the Hololens and other Augmented Reality technologies are doing will really [lastname]e the face of communication and the way we learn in the future. Why did you pick the Hololens over other VR technologies and what plans do you have to measure it's effectiveness (especially given that it's not out yet)? I think if you can find a way to measure it's impact, this could be a great way to boast about the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of VR technologies."	9/11/2015 9:26	518	7	"I selected HoloLens because that is the technology we are getting ready to investigate at work and I want to improve the research effort here at work. We plan to work with Microsoft and I also responded to a Microsoft Academic Request for Proposals and if the moons align and that is accepted, I will have at least one device to evaluate. I would be very interested in following your research in Oculus Rift and will share with you all of my fin[lastname]gs."
Student87	Student11	2	I think the fact that you have a working idea in place with poten[firstname]l pitfalls speaks a lot about the validity of it. One thing I really like about your idea is that it's very feasible and solid. You likely won't have to narrow down from a higher level like many (inclu[lastname]g myself) and can begin working on a prototype pretty quickly. I'm really looking forward to seeing more on how this works and if Udacity decides to possibly integrate it into their system.	9/11/2015 9:35	524		
Student87	Student74	2	The best part of your assignment is that you outline the competition and what you hope to improve on with the competition. This gives you a leg up on many people in this class because you have a clear goal in mind and what you hope to accomplish (many of us are still wandering around in the dark about our topics). Have you thought about a feedback mechanism where a person can critique the video and then allow the teacher to upload a new one possibly correcting the mistakes or maybe add on a sub-video explaining a concept in more depth?	9/11/2015 9:43	1623	7	
Student33	Student77	2	"This is well thought out. I see where you are going with this. I like how you defined the core issues and addressed each one methodically. The defined the Issue, set the Context and then solution. maybe one option that is design flaw on requesting professor feedback may be to add a button that requests that the professor provide feedback specifically and rate the importance."	9/11/2015 10:58	266		
Student33	Student4	2	I think that this was excellent. Well Done. I like how you evaluated the Pros and Cons of each of these individual Platforms and was able to methodically look at how there may be room for improvement. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.	9/11/2015 11:03	222	6	
Student33	Student66	2	This is excellent [firstname]. I can totally relate to what you are discussing regar[lastname]g keeping kids engaged while also teaching co[lastname]g concept. I am very interested in this topic since my research is also involved around teaching kids to code but mainly 6-11 elementary aged kids. I look forward to seeing where you go with this. Have you thought about Scratch and Tinker?	9/11/2015 11:09	175		
Student33	Student60	1	This is a really cool topic. This is the first time that I have seen group formation in this format. It will be interesting to see how your tool works. Are there parameters that professors will be able to adjust to perform these formations. I am looking forward to your research.	9/11/2015 11:12	5205	6	Nice ideas are coming up from feedback. I like the feedback.
Student49	Student24	1	"I like the idea, and you even have some psuedo code ready for moving forward. Maybe think of a short questionnaire to assess personality habits, like they do on dating sites. Reason I propose that is, although folks may be [firstname]ghted towards each other on other factors, personality and habits also contribute to the success of a team when alike folks are paired."	9/11/2015 12:40	549	7	Thanks [firstname]. Appreciate your feed back. I will take your suggestion into consideration. There will be some questionnaire form to fill when they register the first time or I can prepopulate some basic information from Introductions.
Student49	Student70	1	"I understand your approach and have seen this done in the past for products, not blog oriented. A few questions to ask yourself would be, what current technology can I leverage? Would I be competing with other applications in the industry, if so who? Once developed how scaleable is it to apply to other analysis applications. Sounds to me using natural language processing apis to collect this data and store it in a database is your best bet, might want to check what's currently out there. Also might want to look into how to automate blog fin[lastname]g and crawling of the web to index the data."	9/11/2015 12:49	1073	6	
Student49	Student56	1	"I understand your angle and it is a very important one, but am a little confused on your approach to a solution. Research is great, but what you do with gathered research data is what I would like to understand. I guess you can figure that out a little more into research. Might want to check out some big data analysis technologies and think of a way to access/gather then visualize answers to the problems."	9/11/2015 13:07	7495		
Student49	Student87	1	"Using cutting edge vr technology would be awesome in the school environment! We could simulate the magic school bus, haha. As some feedback, maybe look into if these forms of technology are being used elsewhere for educational purposes, if you can expand on existing applications or would be competing with other applications. Maybe also look into some further visual/auditory etc studies on how to better develop the approach combining the two poten[firstname]l solution areas."	9/11/2015 15:12	465		
Student98	Student99	1	"Great idea for your project! I like how you are joining different projects together and inclu[lastname]g them in your design. It would have been interesting to see statistics or facts in the problem definition. Some questions for thought. Are there any solutions in the field today? If so, what are there downfalls compared to your solution downfalls. I also like the methodology section and the image provided. Who will be responsible for maintaining the website and the database? How will you advertise the tool? Again, great idea!"	9/11/2015 14:22	728		
Student98	Student3	1	"Great idea for your project! I like that this project is current and can possible be explored by the educational industry after the completion of the course. Two questions came to mind... 1. What are the benefits of improving the technology? 2. Is 21st century technology too outdated for the purpose of learning? I like that there was more than one purposed solution. That identifies that more time and research will be poured into the project to discover the best option. Again, great idea!"	9/11/2015 14:34	626		
Student98	Student44	1	"Great idea for your project! I liked how you provided references to back up your research. However, I wished you discussed them more instead of listing them. I like the way the paper was formatted. How will you publish your results? What are some of the issues you might face? It seems like your research is very productive. Again, great idea!"	9/11/2015 14:45	477		
Student98	Student20	1	"Great idea for your project! I agree that this project is needed for any and all grade levels. I like the format of the paper. You did great on provi[lastname]g technology that exist already and the drawbacks for your proposed solution.

You mentioned presenting possible solutions (drawing on international solutions) to these problems--what are you planning as an output to this research precisely? Who is the audience for your research fin[lastname]gs--government? Ed Tech Innovators? Academia in general? Thanks! [firstname]"	9/11/2015 17:03	549	7	"I try to approach feedback in the same manner as [firstname]: asking direct questions regar[lastname]g the outcome. In short, the audience will be for the actual school system. Closely aligned to academia in general. This is beneficial as I try to narrow down this project."
Student99	Student44	1	"Hi [firstname], Very interesting idea. How do you plan to qualify/quantify different aspects about well-used apps? Do any of the articles provide a method for measuring ""motivation"" in an app? How would you measure the effects of aesthetics/design on whether the app will be used? Thanks! [firstname]"	9/11/2015 17:12	287		
Student99	Student20	1	"Hi [firstname], Cool idea--do you have any specific thoughts on how to engage middle/high school students with math and science without making them ""blatantly academic and shallow...""? Are there any games out there that are fun and engaging that require learning trig or calculus that you are hoping to draw on/emulate and adapt to the kinetically-oriented game space?

Student77	Student21	1	"I really like this idea--I know when I was a first semester student in OMSCS, I relied heavily on feedback from other students (the ""unofficial course review"" spreadsheet) to understand what I would need to know prior to the class, inclu[lastname]g not only what programming languages and concepts I should be familiar with, but how much time I should be committing per semester and what kind of tests, papers, projects, evaluations would take place. Are you thinking of incorporating all this information, or just the technical requirements?"	9/11/2015 17:11	183		
Student77	Student4	1	"Wow, this is a huge undertaking. It sounds like you're trying to solve all the problems across EdTech all at once--my recommendation would be to narrow the focus a bit more and scope it back to addressing one particular issue. For example, your bullet ""Instant feedback to students about their understan[lastname]g of a subject"" could be it's own project! Is that feedback by an instructor? Another student? An AI agent that learns from information already on the forum combined with resources like StackOverflow and github?"	9/11/2015 17:14	181	6	
Student77	Student60	1	"You have some strong research here, I would pose one question for you to think about, however: for programs like OMSCS, this kind of application would make sense (since we have set deadlines, are all working on the same thing at the same time, etc). For the vast MOOC population (where a single class can have thousands of students), how do you set up a process like this without infringing on the asynchronous benefits that MOOCs provide? I.e., being able to learn at your own pace, take a week off if you need to, move faster when you have extra time, etc?"	9/11/2015 18:20	122	6

Student86	Student47	1	"[lastname], I liked the topic that you have chosen for the research. I am a firm believer of promoting the good instead of wasting the energy on punishing the worst. In that way, I really liked your idea of �Good Behavior Game�, where you reward the student for appropriate on-task behavior. As you have mentioned ""There are many classroom management strategies and techniques that have been tested and promoted to teachers"" -- It would be a great idea to provide some references and the outcome of those techniques. Overall, great research topic."	9/11/2015 17:26	325		
Student86	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname], I like your topic of research Intelligent Tutoring Systems. I am sure ITS are going to be used more and more in the industry as MOOCs are going to be widely used in teaching in general. I am sure your topic is going to be useful in the industry.

I am sure your tool will help many existing and new students for on boar[lastname]g , monitoring the progress of the program and being informative of the choices presented in the program and taking better decisions while progressing on the program. Please try to a feature that gets the data from t-square and gives you a one-stop snapshot of all the assignments/projects/quiz due dates. That will be useful."	9/11/2015 17:56	421

After I figured it out, it was clear that the subject is an edtech replacement for standardized testing. However, this is an amorphous definition, which is natural, since that's where we are in the idea process. It took me a minute to figure this out. Admittedly, I am tired, but many of your readers will be rea[lastname]g tired. A label will make it click. Do you envision buil[lastname]g an edtech tool to answer your questions? Will this be an investigation of what's out there, or will there be an experiment? Do you have a particular domain in mind? No child left behind implies K-12, but many tools are either focused in a narrower or different domain. Furthermore, K-12 is broad. Do you need to stay that broad to get results, or can you zoom in on a single aspect, such as STEM? What is your motivation for working on this? Have you experienced problems from no child left behind? Do you deal with standardized tests?"	9/11/2015 17:52	1806		
Student80	Student24	1	"As it happens, I am doing team related research this semester, too. One could even call it team matching. However, I'm using game theory to look for a way to identify freeloaders. I think the idea of a common platform would facilitate easy of use for students, but also extension, for developers. What stack would you use? My thought is to stick to python since so many classes utilize it. Interestingly, I haven't been in any that use python for the web. The mention of bipartite matching reminds me of the quantitative section of the course library. Have you looked into it? I'm considering either Pearson's r or ANOVA for fin[lastname]g correlation between game sessions and group cooperation. Have you researched whether profile matching is the right metric? Unfortunately, the quantitative data is minimal, but I have found some publications that might be of interest.

It would be great if they could share some code, so even if the teams were not the same, they could take advantage of each other's work instead of reduplicating everything. what kind of research is there on adult education and distraction? Will your work contain an experimental angle? How will you measure student motivation? It seems like you have direct experience with the issue, based on your work. How can you tie academic research in to enhance your experience? It seems there are a few texts on the subject, such as Enhancing adult motivation to learn: A comprehensive guide for teaching all adults by RJ Wlodkowski http://sag.sagepub.com/content/33/2/157.short which relates to gaming.

Student80	Student70	1	"Could this tool be applied outside blogs? For example, to research papers. The difficulties seem similar, and I've certainly opened enough papers just to hit the back button after I conclude that the research isn't useful. I regard to categories, I often find myself thinking about tags and directory hierarchies when I am trying to organize information. Tags are great because they can do most of what directories can do, but they are very simple to implement (basically just a tag list and a habtm xref table). Two entries with the same tag are basically in the same folder, but they can also be in another folder without causing management issues. The main failing of tags is lack of hierarchy, although hierarchy can be added to tags, that destroys some of their simplicity.

Student100	Student58	1	"$2500 - 5000 per course PER WEEK. It's expensive. Much more so for the Udacity / GaTech model with high production quality. But really this strengthens your argument. At least if we believe that there's a real incentive for a university to improve completion rates (honestly, I'm not really sure about that). Regardless, it's a good research question. For this course, the research design may be sufficient. It would be very difficult, however, to convince reviewers of the external validity of the research given the significant differences between OMSCS and traditional MOOCs. I wonder whether just studying this without trying to externalize it to MOOCs wouldn't be a better plan? I also wonder whether completion rates are the only dependent variable worth examining here? Might you also look at satisfaction scores from the end of semester evaluations? Probably some other relatively easy metrics to look at here, as well.

Though I would guess that it's catching the lazy students and they are the ones least likely to expend the effort to cover their tracks. It got me wondering how hard it would be to write the ""cheaters"" tool by which you can test the existing tools. For example, have something that takes an assignment and modifies it to varying degrees to see how far you have to go before it passes as new work. Just out of cu[lastname]ity, do any of the tools plot a deviation level from the ""standard""? For example, could you look at a chart and see that most assignments follow a bell curve and then a few stack up as being too similar; which warrant further review? This is assuming that you use a preprocessor to run the other tools. Perhaps you could even run more than one tool to get more coverage."	9/11/2015 20:36	614	7

You reminded me of when I first took my first and only psychology class in college back in 1984. for a project that I was working on I conducted a personal experiment on long term vs. short term memory. I had decided to attempt to learn 100 digits of PI and measure my retention after studying PI for six hours on evening using repetition, pneumonics, and other techniques. After only six weeks I lost the last 50 digits, but, even to this day, I still retained the first 51 digits inclu[lastname]g the ini[firstname]l ""3."". I am tempted to just write out what I know, but I digress. Your research is very interesting and I eagerly wait how you will map out and implement your project. I can relate to the challenge of fin[lastname]g the right research papers and reports to help you in your endeavor.

But realizing that I could take my learning from other classes like Math to build stuff was very motivational for me to want to understand how stuff works. A class centered around Raspberry Pi's and electronics would be a cool approach to build stuff and learn about how you can program to interact with it. Again, tying in other classes like Science and Physics could be a selling point? Drones could be introduced too for learning GIS (that also has computer science programming components too).

The paper seems to swing the focus in between how promoting the teaching of co[lastname]g in lower income communities can help break the poverty cycle, and on the effect of early co[lastname]g instruction on choosing a career on a STEM field. While those seem to overlap at some point, both topics are huge on their own, and a quick google search shows previous research on them seems to have taken a lot of resources. As you've mentioned, there are multiple institutions that are having programs (after school or weekend type) that can probably provide you with some research and ideas to implement them in a community. Many community-level programs are also available in numerous cities (I am a part of such an effort in my little town!). Please don't take this critique as an indication of non-interest on your topic. All the contrary! I think efforts to increment the amount underrepresented groups in any discipline are extremely important, and the lower-income communities have had a historic underrepresentation in the technology field. If it because of this interest that I think you can do great things with good focus. Lastly, you may want to consider having someone review your paper.

It increases the ""professional"" look of it ten fold! I absolutely love your topic. I think the problem is well identified, but that you may have a lot of work cut out in front of you to identify ways to leverage constructivism in harmony with an LMS. There are a few resources I came across while doing a research on the topic last summer that might come in handy for you: Lave, J., & Wegner, E. (1991). Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. This books talks about the importance of being able to follow experts in real projects in order to become an expert yourself. Matthews, M. R. (1998). Constructivism in Science Education: A Philosophical Examination. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers. This is a group of papers that criticize constructivism. While it may seem backwards, it help me realize by some of its shortcomings what were its real strong points. You can find a lot of Von Glasersfeld's papers on his website: http://www.vonglasersfeld.com/. He is regarded as one of the main advocates for constructivism. Another author that has written copiously about constructivism is [lastname]ders Duit. I found these two papers by him increadibly helpful: Duit, R. (1996). The Constructivist View in Science Education - What It Has to Offer and What Should Not Be Expected From It. Investigac?o?es em Ensino de Cie?ncias , I (1), 40-75. Duit, R. (1995).

Modifying existing intelligent tutors to teach diagnosis at an early stage? Creating your own intelligent tutor? All of those sound like extremely good options, but I fear that trying to pursue all of them at the same time might result in much more work that can be done in a single semester! The idea of teaching diagnosis early sounds fascinating. Yet, I cannot wrap my mind around being able to diagnose something without having a good grasp on the theory behind what is being diagnosed. Would you not learn just specific scena[lastname] rather than actual underlying knowledge by diagnosing before learning? It would definitely be extremely beneficial in some areas! Lastly, you might benefit from narrowing your research to a specific domain, and then trying to generalize it.

I would get a little more focused and begin to think what you can actually deliver in just 1 semester. See my comments below for what I mean. 1. Are you aware of any other simulations or projects in this subject area? Unfortunately I'm completely unfamiliar with this are altogether so I am not aware of other simulations in this area. 2. My sub-goal in this project is to provide a tool for Varian that can be used in a staff training scenario. Varian has lawyers to review issues similar to incorporating GPL licensed code in our software, myself I do not have any. What have your experiences been with using GPL licensed code in commercial software, given a possible scenario of using the tool in a class that our customers may pay to attend? I cannot given any type of licensing advice as I'm not familiar. I'm sure this question has been asked somewhere or you could review the GPL. Try checking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Use_of_licensed_software It sounds like if the source code is available you can do with it whatever you want. 3. Should I extend the existing simulator, and give back to the community? Or should I use the existing tool as a basis for my work, credit the originators of the work, and start fresh? Which is most feasible in the given amount of time? Which product will come out more polished and usable? 4. It wasn�t until doing this assignment that I thought of the idea of incorporating intelligent tutors into a teaching scenario using the existing tool. Would that be a better project? Or should I focus on improving the foundation of the tool before ad[lastname]g on extras like an intelligent tutoring system? I would accomplish the first project before creating a second project. If your pour a lot of time into this you might be able to get both done, but I would focus on the simulation first. 5. One of the concerns raised in the SIMAC paper5 was that it was too resource intensive to simulate the linear accelerator beam on a personal computer. This is the justification as to why a lot of the calculations are hard-coded. Assuming this restriction is still valid, should I move the calculations to the cloud? This would allow the user to have a more realistic simulation but still be able to run the simulator on desktop-caliber hardware? If it is feasible, why not? Making the simulator more available makes it more useful."	9/12/2015 12:13	589	6	"Maybe this was due to the discussions during the week, but this is a detailed response to my assignment.

There are huge privacy concerns about this, but it seems you did a bit of research into that. Once you find a trend in the data what actions will be taken? For example if you find people of a lower economic status are scoring lower, what can be done about this that is new? Is your goal to simply create a data bin or to solve complex problems? Right now the traditional method is students get grades, you get grade reports before your final grade and your parents review your grades. Parents also meet with teachers face to face to get feedback. Based on these meetings and report cards students can study more, get a tutor, etc. Does your method provide a solution or just collect data?"	9/12/2015 12:54	433	6	"The feedback provided a different set of view points.

In other words, it seems that presenting it as a learning opportunity that happens to contain some elements of a game is the approach you'd like to take. Regar[lastname]g symbolism, I wonder if giving the learner an opportunity to choose their iconography might help with motivation. For instance, if your daughter feels as though her perceived failures are being met with a lack of love, maybe earning hearts would be more motivating for her. In other words, maybe different learners are motivated by different symbolism. Your essay regar[lastname]g using elements of music therapy was a little abstract for me to understand, perhaps because I don't understand the components of music therapy. I'd be interested in learning how elements of music therapy can assist with an Intelligent Tutoring System. Maybe I just needed a use case to understand it better. Good luck with your project and I hope that you're able to create a system that benefits your daughter. That's great motivation."	9/12/2015 14:15	2353	7	Thanks.

If that's the case and this was a [firstname]et survey to see what competitive products exist, I wonder what you can do to differen[firstname]te yourself from the others. Are you a SME on this topic or will you be interviewing SMEs to determine what content to include? How will you assess a learner's capabilities? A virtual lab is great, but that sounds like a lot to accomplish in a single semester. Whatever your path, I wish you luck."	9/12/2015 14:54	2332

I guess that Common Core at least provides a standard by which educational tools can be evaluated. I haven't heard of eSpark before, but it was interesting to learn more about them. Curation of all these fragmented learning tools out there is a respectable goal, but I wonder by what measure do they categorize different educational apps? Do they categorize by learning styles? Difficulty? Also, is there a standard for reporting progress through these apps? I don't know how you could retrieve results from all these apps and store them in a centralized database. It seems like a Herculean task to provide the ""glue"" for all these educational apps. The question of ethics comes into play, as well. Could some app providers pay for eSpark's recommendation? Are the courses evaluated and rated by learners? It raises a lot of questions. Does eSpark not provide something similar to your ""a"" project? Or, are you proposing a publicly accessible search engine for these tools? That would be great, especially for parents of children struggling with a particular topic. Regar[lastname]g your ""e"" project, it sounds similar to what a LMS would handle. Are you familiar with the Common Cartridge ini[firstname]tive? Maybe that would give you some additional direction. It's exciting to live in a time where students can have learning catered to their individual needs. There's still a lot to work out, but it's so much better than having a quarter of the kids bored and another quarter of the kids hopelessly behind.

Here is an excellent analysis written by some Georgia Tech folks, among others: http://englelab.gatech.edu/2013/redick-et-al-20132c-wm-training2c-jepg.pdf I wholeheartedly agree that learning (education?) should occur everyday and that it helps maintain the neuroplasticity of the brain, but it might be interesting research to compare the effectiveness of some of these different tools. I don't know enough about their offerings to say that would work, but I wonder if there isn't a method for running an experiment in which a group of subjects' mental agility and performance can be measured before and after a limited use of these different tools.

In the first one, TA's conducted a survey to evaluate teammates' contribution which was nice. Other project was a web application. When signing up everybody had some skill that they could bring to the team, and when it was time to put it to work they bailed out. Another teammate and myself did all the co[lastname]g and testing. What was frustrating was some of these people would come for team meetings and act like release managers. There was one member in the team who was really good with the design for the application and she did an excellent job creating prototypes and the presentation.

I don't think I have seen a framework that lets students deliver individualized curriculum. There is a lot of interest in the learning community for differen[firstname]ted instruction and assessment. I think the challenge is in assessment. This part is still manual and the way teachers store the level at which the child is rea[lastname]g and so on, are in the form of report card(usually in the comments section). So when the child goes to the next grade, he/she has to go through the assessment again."	9/12/2015 18:50	15	6	"I think I would see start-of-year assessment as being important even in an electronic curriculum because students ""forget"" a lot over the summer, so relying on the previous year's data would be suboptimal."

It would be very tricky. I think for our purposes usefulness remains in the ""instructor has final say""/manual category. What we are going for is have all the auto gra[lastname]g take place to evaluate submission from code perspective, and then for instructor to be able to inspect the submission for ""human usability"" and possibly file organization if there are multiple files, and that will be the final evaluation step."

Student50	Student41	2	"Wow - interesting [lastname]e of direction! This sounds promising, but I've got a couple of thoughts to kick around - You note that you plan on ""instead going to take the approach of connecting learners to human SMEs in a near real-time experience."" This may be an odd question, but who are these SMEs? There are several components here - the first being the scope of your solution. What space would this exist in? Who would comprise the primary audience? Secondly, how are you employing these SMEs you're connecting users to, and who are they? You note that you'd aim to identify these folks up front, but what would happen if this solution needs to scale up significantly? (Either in user base and spectrum of supported contexts?) Later, you mention that, ""when the question is asked, a group of SMEs are notified that a learner has a question. I�m thinking that this needs to be a smartphone notification (SMS, app, etc.). If there is a group of five SMEs, for instance, perhaps they all receive the notification. "" Do you think this will result in spamming and alienating your SMEs? Would an auto-dispatch system work well here, or would that negate the goal of your design? Could this perhaps be opt-in, instead? A la Uber? Or how non-OMS Udacity graders are managed? There's lots to explore in here, but this is a promising concept. I'd look into Facebook's new M assistant (http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/26/facebook-messenger-m-assistant/) if you're not already familiar with it.

However, I think that most of the confusion comes from an unorganized course and not necessarily from its content. While it might be true that people with a low technical skill could have a steeper learning curve for some of the courses, that is also true for other type or courses online or physical. There are a a lot of free online refresher courses on a lot of topics (e.g. Khan Academy, Udacity, Coursera, etc.), so people already resources at their disposal if they need. One of the things that makes this course great is how well organized it is. Weekly announcements on what work is expected for that week, high availability from the instructors in Piazza or Slack, full semester schedule. That falls greatly on the instructors in how they organize and present their courses, but is also great for students to have a single place to look at when they need to know what comes next in the course. I think it would be very cool to see a tool that allows students to have a central place to know what they need to do on a given week (i.e. homework). Maybe it can share some wiki-like features so students who have taken or are taking the course can post some of the skills that they needed to complete it successfully. That way, a student interested in taking the course could know ahead of time if they need to take a refresher course on a particular skill. I didn't know about the existence of Google Course Builder.

For a networking class where there is real world interaction, I can see this actually being a huge benefit"
Student55	Student42	2	"It sounds like you have a good understan[lastname]g of the organizations and ini[firstname]tives involved in this area, not just the technical projects that exist, and it's particularly impressive that you were able to convey a good overall picture of the field while sticking pretty close to the length guidelines. The one point which I'm less clear on is the form of sociological versus pedagogical interventions - is the former represented by the community outreach, and the latter by the vocabulary instruction you mention? It'll be exciting to see your project come to life!"	9/12/2015 23:44	317		
Student55	Student8	1	"This assignment was very strong in establishing the theoretical basis for what you hope to do. I learned a lot about the theory of autistic child development (is that the right term?) from it, and it seems like you've identified a very promising problem (gui[lastname]g autistic children through the process of generalization). I would have valued a few more details on Virtual Learning Environments, and how they differ from games. The paper also mentions that ""the majority of technologies for this method..."" are not video game-related, but the only technology it explicitly describes is the VLE. Are there others which didn't make the final cut? Exciting stuff, and if you do create a good framework for this I think it will make a real difference in the treatment of autistic children. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/13/2015 1:06	467		
Student55	Student78	1	"Fascinating references in this paper - Gaze Tutor sounds particularly interesting! This feels as though it's a bit broad. It's not quite clear what area of ITS you are honing in on - are you focusing primarily on student engagement with intelligent tutors at this point? If so, the current ITS systems mentioned are all intriguing, but I struggle a bit to understand how they relate to the theme of student engagement specifically. ITS are a big interest of mine as well, so I'll be excited to see what you come up with. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/13/2015 1:16	377		
Student55	Student95	2	"Wow! I LOVE this idea! And the explanation of why your current solution is inadequate [the amount of time spent on the physical build-out, as opposed to programming] is very cogent. I can easily see how this will segue into an EdTech project - which is pretty cool, since its hardware focus makes it very different from all of the EdTech projects I've seen discussed so far. (Side note: I had no idea how many starter hobbyist robot kits were out there. I'm both heartened and terrified.) It will be interesting to see how far you go with this - I can see how just the part list and instructions would be helpful, but at the same time I can imagine a whole host of ""extras"" that would make it even better: an online community, example programs... the sky's the limit. Whatever you choose to do with it, I hope it is a boon to your class and beyond. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/13/2015 1:14	906

Student47	Student94	1	"I have not hard of the Montessori Approach before, thanks for the thorough explanation. I think researching the integration of computers into the montessori curriculum is a very interesting topic. The traditional classroom is so rigid, but technology allows for so much more flexibility and collaboration so it seems like a natural fit to montessori. But as you have discovered, there are still some disadvantages with it. I'd like to learn more about those challenges. Also, apparently Larry Page, Sergei Brin, Jeff Bezos, Will Wright, Jimmy Wales, all went to Montessori schools...pretty cool."	9/13/2015 0:15	1663		
Student47	Student91	1	"TBH, trying to build such an AI seems impossible to me, but its exactly what the OMS interactive intelligence tract is all about. Maybe it can start off as a wiki where students help to compile notes and guides (and that can be part of a students participation grade) and there is an AI agent on the coursera/udacity/edx side that consumes the contents of the wiki and automatically generates questions that tests whether the student is understan[lastname]g the subject matter or not."	9/13/2015 0:43	780		
Student47	Student2	1	"Pretty cool topic, I know with a lot of the new language learning apps like duolingo and brain training apps like lumosity, they supposedly work because it educates you in short bursts. I look forward to seeing what comes out of your paper. Also, I have an app idea: Texting is so common nowadays.

Student30	Student4	2	"Hi Student4, I applaud your interest in this topic, and agree that there is plenty of room for innovation in tools to teach co[lastname]g. What I would add is that sites like codecademy.com, which I like - especially the Python module - are a snappy introduction to co[lastname]g, but there is much room for advanced tutorials, and entire system of presenting students with progressively more complex practical co[lastname]g applications. The real challenge as you point out is identifying features and a methodology and larger program that ties all this together. I'm reminded of the Zen of Python by Tim Peters: https://www.python.org/doc/humor/#the-zen-of-python when it comes to identifying a high-level rubric for beautiful co[lastname]g and a framework for teaching this to students.

Student30	Student48	1	"Hi [firstname], I agree that educational inequality is a major challenge for this country and that distributed education systems may be a big component in mitigating this rather vexing problem. If I understand where you are headed, you seem to be proposing research into distributed learning systems and their adoption and best fit in a mix of school programs. I'm unclear on the current state of research on this, but imagine that there is tremendous need for more research and pilot programs at every level. I have some experience with Connections Academy and although it is an interesting and worthwhile ini[firstname]tive, it suffers - if you read the reviews - from many dissatisfied teachers who complain of poor pay, long hours and lack of support, and parents and students who complain of a lack of support and interaction with teachers, and of poor response rates - the teachers say this is largely because they are woefully understaffed, and in my limited experience the infrastructure to support interactive feedback and follow-up is poor. Just my $0.02, but I offer it to highlight the many practical challenges these programs face, Student30 Student30"	9/13/2015 0:47	707	7	
Student13	Student65	1	"Thanks for your great review [firstname]! I am excited to see that you will be working with [firstname] on this project as he is phenomenal also! In terms of your work I believe that your narrower scope will better fit your project. I like your analysis of the problem and identify with the problems that you faced with paper / book formats. Overall, as I think about pushing ahead with the project, I would encourage you to focus on the goals section of the project. I think your goals are awesome. My question to you now is how or why will they work. For example, if you develop a tool that allows an instructor to choose MC AP exam questions from a test bank, what specific dimension of experience is that addressing? And, has there been any research or any other comparative app's out there that poten[firstname]lly have the same functionality to support? Also, question tagging by topic and difficulty. Who would do that? Would it be subjective? Machine based classification? Also, students given feedback and suggestions for their answers. I would be curious to really deeply see how this piece might work or what you can find here. What is the best way to give students feedback? How would you build it in? How often should they get feedback? Why? And, if you were going to track student performance over time, what specific dimensions would you look to track? Hopefully that helps as a start. My biggest question now, is to challenge the why? Think carefully about the goals and requirements, and have fun rea[lastname]g and researching for the next project on why those requirements might make sense! I am sure you are going to develop an amazing final project and I look forward to collaborating & am here to help if I can (so don't hesitate to reach out!) - Nate (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/13/2015 2:49	1246	7	
Student13	Student22	1	"Hi Jim! I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your assignment 2 review. Looks like you have some very interesting ideas left and a poten[firstname]l project eam who sounds very good! Incorporating co[lastname]g for middle school students and doing that kind of research sounds wonderful! When I think of your ideas, if you haven't already, have a look at things like Co[lastname]Game! I am fully immersed myself in it and am loving every minute! Covers all three of the pieces that you noted (in my opinion)! In terms of being research oriented & thinking forward, I had a few thoughts. At one point you mention poten[firstname]lly contrasting middle school to older adult programmingnkowledge. You then propose a checklist. Have you thought about answering that checkist or proposing answers for the two different groups you identified? For example, would a middle school learner be more likely to be able to jump into the middle of a training sequence vs than an older adult? What would impact that positively or impair that? What is in the literature? That exercise for every question might just help you narrow things down and fill out more content from a research perspective! You might also ask yourself HOW you would test this? In your research proposal, how would you precisely evaluate whether a middle school learner can jump quickly into something more easier than an adult learner? Good luck, and be sure to reach out if you have any questions! Am excited to see what you and your team accomplish! -Nate (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/13/2015 3:17	692		
Student13	Student64	1	"Hi [firstname]! It was great to read your work. I loved rea[lastname]g your ini[firstname]l discussion of intelligent systems and how their ability to assess their effectivness has been challenging. I like your thought of using ""Big Data"" to actually review this effectiveness. Your discussion of InBloom was also interesting due to the fun[lastname]g. I am not surprised that it was shut down as the story reminds me of the challenge that the folks in health records & health information management hav been facing. I am still not sure whether communication would have fixed it. That said, it was curious. As I think more about your project, as it sounds like you are back at the start, I would encourage you to dig into the literature on intelligent agents more. Perhaps you might try to narrow it down on a sub topic ... like intelligent agents for teaching programming ... Maybe they presented their users with a strong enough use case to share information. These sources would also give you insight into HOW you might cluster data to personalize a student experience. I would ask you two questions here - what would you cluster against if I could give you any data you wanted, and how would you take the output from that process and personalize? Just some food for thought that hopefully helps the next phase! Good luck, and reach out if you need anything at all! -Nate (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/13/2015 3:29	379		
Student13	Student7	1	"Hi Ben! I love the concept that you have. So many people are intimidated by the thought of starting something new and I love what you are doing! In terms of your learning goals, as you think of the next phase of the project, there are a few things I would ask you. Firstly, when you talk about ""teaching the basis of the iOS app development"" ... is there any consideration around HOW? I see you talk about using a Swift Playground. How or why is that an optimal environment for learning? Is there anything else from literature? Is the act of doing an intro, exampe, problem all backed up (thinking of the DEER methodology .... demonstrate, explain, execute, review / repeat). Again, just want to encourage you to take the leap and really think about the why. I have the same feedback for the other pieces! When you talk about equiping students to make a leap from steps to app buil[lastname]g, how would you do that? How much time does it take? And, how do you really do step 3 in a meaningful way? You give an awesome list of existing resources. That said, you note that your solution would just try to address the weak points of each solution. Is that sufficient to make great progress? Again, loving what you are doing & am looking forward to seeing what you develop. If you need any help from me don't hesitate to reach out! Cheers! -Nate (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	9/13/2015 3:41	44

Just a quick note, I'm not too familiar with how extensions are built, but my guess would be each browser has its own extension API.

Student84	Student46	1	"I like this topic a lot. I either have read your previous assignment or read something about your focus on Piazza. 1. I think you could benefit from narrowing down your age group. 2.Longer question with a build up :) I understand that this is not the main focus of your topic but it is a question I always ask myself when such topics come up. If weren't allowed to ignore 10 out of a group of 100 testers who don't enjoy or like programming or computers at all. Also for your final product, and you have to have a 95% approval rating from that group. How could you gain that 5%? What is that x factor that your tool will provide to engage even the most negative users. I always ask myself this when I see games are used as tools to teach. I'd like to see how this turns out."	9/13/2015 6:15	978	6	Overall good feedback. I will definitely think about some of the issues [firstname] has raised.
Student84	Student10	1	"This is interesting. Even though I'm not interested in learning any new languages, utilizing Natural Language Processing to basically maximize the effectiveness of flashcards technique or any other ones seems like a pretty logical idea. I think you may need to find a stopping point on how far down the NLP path you want to go with this project considering the time we have. If I were in your shoes I would make it as focused as possible on just one technique as well as some parts of NLP and then test out this idea to have some test results with your final product / product concept."	9/13/2015 6:31	753

For some reason, the excitement of saying something ""an adult would say"" struck us as fun and helped us to feel more mature.

Student14	Student67	2	"[firstname], motivation is a powerful tool! I really believe that tools/applications that focus on this would help to bridge the gap in socio-economic, gender, age gaps (and in the like) in the aspects of education.
