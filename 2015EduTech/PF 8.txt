Student60	Student2	1	"Very interesting project. I liked the idea of collecting reviews on the fly. Which such interfaces can be useful, it can loose its value over time. Do you plan to introduce some reward points. or stars, or army grade of user to keep them motivated? I look forward to see your final product."	10/25/2015 13:04	349		
Student60	Student56	1	"Interesting project and good progress thus far. As I was rea[lastname]g through the introduction, I was realizing how vast this could be. Word length seems to be a fair heuristics, though I might argue that if it is not covering the important point you might want to extend the answer."	10/25/2015 18:42	1255		
Student60	Student4	1	Your project is very interesting and it would be for sure a helpful platform for students. I believe you are limited to just the basic concepts of programming. Your progress also looks fine to me. All the best for your project.	10/25/2015 19:03	1470		
Student60	Misc3	1	Your project is interesting and your progress too looks good. I agree with you that it would be challenging to tune Physics to a realistic level. I look forward for your project. All the best.	10/25/2015 19:28	1106		
Student40	Student21	2	"Very nice document format (the font makes it feel more like one of the product brochures I typically read off of a vendor's site, which means it looks professional from my point of view :-). It seems like you guys have made a ton of progress...really the primary difficulty seems in being able to collect all of the needed data to integrate into the site, which is honestly the biggest stumbling block for a project like this with so many different poten[firstname]l data sources. I think the products you mentioned for testing and API documentation are currently the best options out there (Postman is really good and I think I see that apiDoc project get used/recommended a lot online). I think the only item I may have wished to see in greater detail would be the actual site since from what I read above it sounds like it is live and online so it would have been kind of neat to check out as I was writing this. Seems like you guys are on track though! Good luck with the next phase :-)."	10/25/2015 13:10	233		
Student40	Student42	1	"Hi Team, I'm guessing the decision making process behind which Framework you wanted to use (amongst all of those extra little decisions that have to be made at the beginning of a project) probably took the longest (that was certainly the case for me). I liked reviewing the mockup images, that definitely seems where most of the work will be occurring once the overall backend basics have been setup (fin[lastname]g images by itself may be a challenge). On the presentation side, I'm not sure if it will be helpful or not, but the following presentation oriented HTML5 libraries might be useful: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js https://github.com/impress/impress.js http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/ (I mainly mention these because they may make it easier to arrange things as they appear in your mockup images). I feel you are in a similar boat as myself...some of the basic foundational decisions and work has occurred, but now a lot of the more in-depth stuff comes next so I wish you luck in the next stages!"	10/25/2015 13:14	2312		
Student40	Student20	1	"I think the part of this project I'm most interested about is the Guacamole part (not just because it's delicious, but also because it's HTML5 based :-). Overall it sounds like your team has put in a lot of work setting up the base parts of the application, but with all of the moving parts mentioned above, I'm definitely curious to see what steps would be needed, let's say for my own organization, if we wanted to implement this system (I know documentation will come later, I'm just curious how straightforward the implementation process might be at the end once everything is completed). I don't know if you guys are working in a private repo, but I think having a link to the repo might have been the only thing I missed seeing above...I would have liked to go and check out some of the Angular and NodeJS, just out of personal interest from my end (I was spen[lastname]g some time working through the tutorials for KnockoutJS the other week, in the hopes I might use it for my project, but I ended up putting further learning for that on hold temporarily...but I definitely liked what I saw, and I know that Angular provides similar benefits). Good luck in the next stages of the project!"	10/25/2015 13:52	1046		
Student40	Student67	1	"I think since you first mentioned the Ionic framework a few weeks back it looked pretty interesting so I took another look at it again today. It took me a few moments to get to your Repo page based off of the screenshot you provided above (https://github.com/[firstname][lastname]/SparkEd) so I was checking it out from there and then tried taking a look at the Ionic Creator area, but since that requires an account and stuff I went looking to see how I might be able to run the project locally since I have npm installed. So I downloaded your code and extracted it then I ran the npm line mentioned on the Ionic site: npm install -g cordova ionic And once that finished installing I typed ""ionic help"" because I can't build the ios or android versions but I wanted to try out the web interface for the app. After some review, it appeared that ""ionic serve"" was what I wanted and that allowed me to view the app in my browser. It's pretty neat! For the notifications I'm curious if you're taking advantage of the new ""Push"" functionality mentioned on the Ionic site, or if you're making use of an SMS service such as Twilio, or Plivo? Overall, it seems like the Ionic Creator system is pretty darn helpful so it might be something for me to look into eventually. Good luck on the next stages of your project!"	10/25/2015 14:10	1994		
Student82	Student86	2	Great task list! It's very detailed and organized. I am unclear on what was scaled back. Is it just because [firstname] may or may not be able to teach using the same curriculum? I don't think that should be a huge so long as the remaining three members still are.	10/25/2015 13:18	351		
Student82	Student90	1	"Holons is a good find! I'm working on automated essay evaluation, and I envisioned each domain knowledge module being self-contained. I think a little more detail in the task list would be good. Instead of programming, to specifically state what will be worked on, but other than that everything looks good and I can't wait to see the finished project."	10/25/2015 13:24	312		
Student82	Student63	2	"It might be too late, but you should check out Panda3d (http://www.panda3d.org/). It has a browser extension for it's game engine and it might not take too much to port your existing Python code over. It's my favorite game engine because it is easy to pick up and learn, and yet powerful enough to produce great looking games. Based on the screenshots provided, I think it looks good for the education level it's being designed for (and certainly better than I could have come up with)!"	10/25/2015 13:30	224		
Student82	Student70	1	"The mock-ups look good! I would have enjoyed seeing an instance of it running, even if it was just allowed me to register and login."	10/25/2015 13:37	156		
Student88	Student33	1	"Sounds like you are making excellent progress towards your goals and the interviews are going well. Before you conduct the interviews are you sen[lastname]g out a FAQ or background information to help align the conversation? You mention how you are fin[lastname]g a lack of awareness of the lack of CS workers and also confirming the fact that CS courses are not being taught in these schools. What is your final artifact going to look like? Are you proposing how to fix this? One other interesting bit that I strongly agree with, is the lack of parental involvement and encouragement to students. School is pushed as this thing to go do by parents, but parents do not actively participate with their children's learning. Is there something you are going to state or suggest to fix this?"	10/25/2015 13:07	2277	7	
Student88	Student79	1	"First I LOVE Max und Moritz. In German in High School we [lastname]slated and read that and the original Grimms' fairy tales. This is probably the first time in a long time that I have seen any reference to Max und Moritz :) Anyway.... How well are the [lastname]slations coming back? For example, in your example I see ""alte"" align with ""anciently"" but not knowing the text, I may have expected ""old"". Has this even been a problem? Ideas on a solution? Looking good so far!"	10/25/2015 13:07	2730		
Student88	Student12	1	"I seem to always get your team's paper for peer review :) You mentioned graphs for the front end? What are you trying to do there? Have you looked into d3.js? That is what I am using to construct some maps for my project. re load generation: can't help here, sorry re data mining: I would suggest focusing on a few specific places, like Google+ community. That probably has a pretty good list of things that you should consider for your first round. re measuring effectiveness: I think posting it to Google+ and see how many people use it, recor[lastname]g the number of hits to the site, etc. would be very helpful in measuring its effectiveness. For example, if you get 1000 hits to the main page in the first week and then none after that, maybe it didn't work so well, but if you get a bunch and then still get a consistent hit count, then you probably are doing something right :) Again your website will be very, very valuable in reviewing courses and understan[lastname]g what could be improved, how students need to be prepared and overall status of the program."	10/25/2015 13:07	3112		
Student88	Student32	1	Looking great! Looks like you have made some great progress and are well on your way. I assume that the API is still TODO given rows are not in green that are complete? I didn't see any specific questions so best of luck to you all!	10/25/2015 13:07	3821		
Student39	Student84	1	I have no idea what's actually going on within the project other than some tasks. Would have been nice to see what the project is. See what the sample data was or objects.	10/25/2015 13:49	275		
Student39	Student68	1	"Excellent progress, and good use of the table to represent done deliverables. It's a little difficult to give meaningful feedback when I am not quite sure what the project or intended goal is."	10/27/2015 9:17	167		
Student39	Student22	1	"Posted in the other Report as I got it twice too: Excellent progress, and good use of the table to represent done deliverables. It's a little difficult to give meaningful feedback when I am not quite sure what the project or intended goal is."	10/27/2015 9:17	294		
Student39	Student47	1	"I think you are on track, even with a revised schedule. And you should look for the independent variables between the conclusions that differ. For example, high vs middle school. High income vs low income. STEM vs Liberal Arts. You might be able to find what makes it effective and what makes it ineffective."	10/27/2015 9:17	425		
Student6	Student45	1	"Looks like you are well on your way. It's the DB guy in me, I am curious as to 1. why for some of your tables you are going with a varchar(10) as the id? 2. why is there a userid on the course table? Is that for the person that created the course? 3. I can understand the course/skill xref, but I'm not clear as to what the resource table does. Looking forward to seeing/using the end product."	10/25/2015 15:20	645		
Student6	Student26	1	Looks like you are progressing well. Do you have any plan for user acceptance testing?	10/25/2015 15:31	119	6	"Well, indeed we do. My team member is the accepting user. I can assure you I am getting continuous end user feedback and adjusting the product to that feedback."
Student6	Student101	1	"Looks like you are in the waiting game. Good luck, I know how that feels. For your survey questions, have you thought about classifying some of the responses for (poten[firstname]lly) easier collection of data? How many years have you been teaching: (0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15...etc.) How comfortable are ou with technology: (0 - 10, 0 least comfortable, 10, very comfortable) Do you use: cell phone Do you use: computers Do you use: other Describe below. Hope that makes sense. Good luck!"	10/25/2015 15:33	391	7	Thanks for your help and advice. I will rethink my question format.
Student6	Student58	1	"Wow, looks like you guys have everything very well handled. Good luck!"	10/25/2015 15:40	97		
Student76	Student35	1	"Fascinating project. I am curious how you would measure documentation with this (as it is not listed in the measurement) for tool usage outside the system. I.e. many teams use Google docs/sheets/etc. to commonly collaborate - how do you handle tracking work accomplished outside your system? Frequently, one student would import work others students accomplish into the wiki upon completion. One way I can think of this is to allow students to ""claim"" work (or at least portions of the work) submitted by another student - pen[lastname]g group approval. Also - teams frequently do not assess ba[firstname] well. For example, one student could end up receiving only 10-15% of the total work in requirements in a group of four when due to skillset/expertise ba[firstname] or through poor planning (in the first case, they may be doing as much if not more than other students with less results - and this is not necessarily a bad thing). How does this system capture work assigned vs. delivered? Student76reene Student76"	10/25/2015 15:25	516		
Student76	Student73	1	"https://omscs�advisor.herokuapp.com/setup, https://omscs�advisor�api.herokuapp.com/courses https://omscs�advisor�api.herokuapp.com/specializations Are all broken links at this moment - returning: ""Heroku | No such app There is no app configured at that hostname. Perhaps the app owner has renamed it, or you mistyped the URL."" It is hard to give valuable feedback without UI visualization (I do not have the tools to view your UI through the code). For three weeks worth of work, you have done a significant amount of work - clearly illustrated by the code. Student76reene, Student76"	10/25/2015 15:34	585		
Student76	Student1	1	"What do you consider a statistically significant sample set? One thing that is unclear is if the respondents are non-traditional. I have a couple questions about a few points: ""Students who lack basic computer skills or are distracted by the Internet"" - it seems like these are two wholly separate problems. The approach clearly answers the first part - but does blocking browser tabs work on its on? Most people with internet distractions could ini[firstname]lly use that extension, and then open up another browser technology. Also, how does this work on browsers without plugins (i.e. Edge)? ""Student isolation and disengagement"" - I see this as one of the most challenging problems you identify. There are so many technical platforms used within in our OMSCS - Udacity/Piazza/Google+/Facebook/Snapchat/.... The list goes on. Maybe it would be better to use some type of aggregation for areas of interest - otherwise the student is highly at risk of missing something important that could benefit them. What about language issues? Many non-traditional students do not comprehend even their main language as well as traditional students. How do you ensure they understand concepts without being too verbose? You briefly cover this under decreased ability to process verbal info, however, many of these students have similar issues consuming written content. An interactive environment would increase knowledge significantly in this regard (I've done a bit of study on this topic for my own project). Your project looks very interesting, Sam! I can't wait to see the final release. Student76reene Student76"	10/25/2015 15:44	6602	7

I'm working on an Affective Intelligent Tutoring system using the Kinect (and it's amazing SDK) to understand and address the assistance dilemma common to ITS. I'm able to fairly accurately track engagement using the Kinect and am going to wrap what I've accomplished around a educational provider. I've read and used much of the research you've listed.

Student38	Student55	1	"[firstname], plug me in - I need OMSCS-advisor this week!! But seriously, I would look at the limitation to new students not as a major flaw, just a limitation 'for now'. It just identifies that *this* project is Phase I, and that it addresses the needs of the most needy, which are the first time students. This is an ambitious and far-reaching project overall, so it seems reasonable to scale deliverables for this semester to a subset of the ultimate product. That said, (I seem to hear that phrase a lot in OMSCS)... well so ""that said"", and assuming this is for 1st time students, here are my priorities for your query: 1) Updating the planning algorithm to include additional preferences, availability, keeping specialization options open, and not sure what the 4th is there but maybe it has to do with foundational requirements(?) 2) Updating the planning UI to communicate the above - it is like a diagnosis: you want to know why this or that was recommended 3) Allowing users to create a profile of preferences Looking forward to hearing all about it when done - good luck!"	10/25/2015 16:11	1053		
Student38	Student96	1	"This is a fascinating and really different kind of project. It sounds like you are leveraging a lot of information to achieve your goals and that you are seeing some success. It will be interesting in the final analysis to see some statistics and analysis on what [lastname]es, enhancements led to what kinds of result in the community. Good luck on the project!"	10/25/2015 16:11	1456	6	
Student38	Student66	1	It sounds as though you have been able to sink your teeth into the project and really get if off the ground. Thank your for provi[lastname]g some visual aids about the progress. Do you feel it is all coming together as planned? Is the time commitment to implement as you expected it to be? Looking forward to hearing how it all works out for the teachers and students - good luck with your project!	10/25/2015 16:11	1863		
Student38	Student65	1	"This looks pretty sophisticated and it appears you are well into the implementation. I am taking note of the Stormpath software for future reference (another benefit of Peer Feedback). I don't know what to add except that it is unclear where the AP practice questions are coming from. I think that is just because this is a progress report and provides only a slice of the final picture. Good job working together in a group - I think it is always a challenge when we are not physically close, but on the other hand it enables you to work on truly robust projects (as this is). Good luck!"	10/25/2015 16:11	2555	7	
Student59	Student51	1	"Nice work. It sounds like your are making good progress towards your goal. In terms of feedback on the app screens, I did find the fact that the screens seem to alternate between vertical scrolling and horizontal scrolling a little odd. Perhaps this would make more sense for fully populated screens, but it does seem a bit odd to me. Otherwise, I like the simple layouts and design. I hope your progress continues to be smooth!"	10/25/2015 16:29	873		
Student59	Student18	0	"This felt more like a mini-proposal than a progress report. I do like the layout of the sample screen, and it sounds like you have your tooling set (good choices for a project of this scope, in my opinion). However, I would like to have seen more concerning the progress you've made since submitting your proposal. Maybe this sample screen and tech choices are the progress, but that is not clear from this."	10/25/2015 16:44	189		
Student59	Student24	2	"Awesome progress. Getting to load up and click through the working prototype was quite helpful for understan[lastname]g what you've accomplished so far. My biggest thought after rea[lastname]g through is the group clustering methods. Are you grouping similar or dissimilar types based on the personality tests? Is there research that shows that similar personalities make the best groups? Is there a tiebreaker beyond randomness for groups that have homogenous personality distributions? Perhaps these have been addressed in other assignment, but they are questions I am curious about."	10/25/2015 16:48	730	6	"Thank you [firstname]. Great observations. Right now I am grouping them based on similar personality types for one of the algorithms, but you have a valid point there, I should considering group formation based on diverging personality traits as well. As you mentioned, there is no guarantee that people with similar personalities will get along on group work as well, but for pairing teams I have to draw a line for choosing the criteria for matching students. This is one of the reasons that I have created multiple algorithms - Randomization, Prioritized attributes based or one of the personality based. Although in reality there will still be some teams which will end up having conflicts among-st team member's regardless of our best efforts. I will certainly try to seek out other ways for pairing teams to provide additional options for team formation. Thanks for the great feedback."
Student59	Student29	1	"Nice detailed progress report, particularly the table of tasks. Easy to understand. In terms of explaining concepts like variables, I think some students will benefit from a low-level explanation involve actually memory values. Explaining how memory is laid out, how addresses work, and how variables related to these values might help students who like to know *exactly* what's happening, rather than trying to muddle through an imperfect metaphor. However, i would not expect this to be universally effective."	10/25/2015 17:00	595	6	
Student22	Student30	1	"Hi Ned, Looks like you are coming along just fine, I was able to access your Wiki page today. Sounds like you have pretty much reviewed what you need to organize and publish. It would be nice to have a comprehensive list of what's out there instead of hunting around and pecking with Google and in the end not sure what you're getting without doing a review (such as you are doing for us!). Would be interested in seeing your site when finished! So far so good - Good Luck!"	10/25/2015 17:11	361		
Student22	Student84	1	Hello! It was hard for me to evaluate your progress since I don't know much about your project. However I've noticed that things are prioritized and and [firstname]ed with colors to indicate status. A few items appear to be a bit in jeopardy and there are notes that some items will take less time than thought and some will take more time. Looks like you are very squeezed for time in the next month to complete it all. At this point however that is to be expected - as the first go arounds were just estimates after all. I believe you know where you are headed and are on top of the timeline. Good luck!	10/25/2015 17:18	371

It seems that everyone has a particular bias or bent toward something maybe you can cut through that clutter and lean one way or the other as your final conclusion of the paper. This will be my approach - if you have a better idea I'd like to hear it. One thing I've noticed about today's kids in teaching in computer programming is that you have to constantly fight for attention from that cell phone that they have in their hands - have you seen any research that talks about that new kind of class disruptor? I would be interested in seeing that - as I will talk about in my team's paper too. I did not know about Evernote seems like a very interesting tool that I will have to learn.

Student74	Student90	1	"Hey, [firstname]! It's nice to see the progress on your paper. Having those breakthroughs when you find a topic that fits your idea is great! Sadly, I don't think the song made it to the submission on peer feedback. As far as your schedule goes, I think it looks like you have a good pace defined. Without seeing your full submission, it is difficult to assess how well that is going, but if you have already compiled use cases and requirements, I'd say you should be on your way to having a good product for the final deliverable. Just be careful to not set any of those in stone, as requirements and use cases can definitely see some evolution as you learn more about your problem domain and experiment with any developed portions of it. Good luck!"	10/25/2015 17:43	363	7	
Student74	Student82	1	"Great update! As a word of encouragement, it is good to be able to recognize when scope needs to be refined to fit a constraint. As for the answers: 1) Yes, it looks good! I had a problem where I had to reload once after typing my email address because the browser would not go anywhere after minutes waiting. 2) I was able to upload a document. I had to refresh the page to see it added to the list. After a few minutes waiting, it is still showing N/A. 3) Unless the agent was able to be very detailed and accurate, I think a simplified score makes more sense. 4) It is difficult without seeing all the work you've already done, but it seems at the very least more doable than the previous one. 5) I took KBAI, and I'd say it would be very useful! I am whatever you call the opposite of a procrastinator, which meant I often had the papers written a week or two before they were due. This in ex[lastname]e often made me re-read them a lot, and wonder if I was or not going in a good route. Ciere would've helped put my mind at ease!

Student44	Student68	1	"Yes I can help you. Q1: Yesu plans to ask for feedback via Piazza, and the team mentor can our peers also provide guidance in this area. How can we explain concepts such as these in a different manner? ANS 1: You did not mention what age students were having problems. Not knowing that, I would first ask you to see at what age children are introduced to variables in math. If they have not been, or are just coming into that knowledge area, then they will certainly struggle with the concept of variables in computer science. Beyond that check out URL: http://www.math4childrenplus.com/games/pre-algebra for ideas. Q2: Are there any suggestions you can make to make our research more effective? ANS 2: Yes absolutely. As a program manager (i.e., simultaneous management of multiple project managers), let me provide you w/ my assessment of where you are based on the information you submitted. Your team has completed 41 tasks that were due by 10/24, and list 11 as not complete. To me that means you are 27% behind schedule. I�m now concerned for your ability to complete this research on time. From what you submitted there are two fundamental pieces of information missing from your project plan. That is: (1) �How long will it take to compete each task?� and �How many man-hours (i.e., resource time) does your team have available to complete the project?� Here are my recommendations for to fix this problem in prioritized order of execution: a. Identify the root problem for why the 11 are not completed yet and fix that if you can. Use the �5-WHYs� method (ref: https://www.moresteam.com/toolbox/5-why-analysis.cfm). b. Evaluate if any of the 11 tasks not completed can be dropped or if they are germane to your project and must be finished. Drop the tasks you can live without and keep the rest. c. Make a discrete list of all the tasks remaining to be completed between now and the end of the class. d. As a team, go through each task and brainstorm on what steps/items need to be done in order to complete the task. The list of steps/items to be completed to achieve the task is your action plan for the task. After you have those steps outlined, as a team make your best estimated guess how long it will take to complete each action and then the task as a whole. Do this for EACH and EVERY task you need to complete. When finished, go through and add 10% to each task. Trust me on this. You MUST add the 10% for unknowns. e. Have each team member individually estimate how much time (i.e., man-hours) they are willing to commit to this project between now and the end of the class. Have them break down that time weekly b/c it will vary week to week depen[lastname]g on class, work and holiday schedules. f. Have someone on your team aggregate the available man hours captured by week in the previous step and apply them to your project plan. g. My instinct is that once you go through the process of estimating the time to complete each task and then compare that with the man �hours you have available�you�re going to come up short. At this point you must de-scope the project to a level that is within the available resource time. h. Once you have this work completed you will have a manageable project plan. During your weekly meetings a part of the time should be spend on why work did not get completed and adjusting the plan to accommodate. Let me know if you have any questions. I will offer my services to assist you or answer questions. This is what I do for a living�so I can help. (Email: Student44) Good luck!"	10/25/2015 19:21	2287		
Student44	Student39	1	"Interesting project. It appears from you submission that you are making good progress. I did not see a project plan or other timeline of the work you are to complete between now and the end of the course. I also did not see any specific questions or problems that you were having. Although a project plan would be helpful...actually is almost a critical item,...I'll presume you have one and simply did not include it here. My recommendation is stay the course and I look forward to reviewing your completed project."	10/25/2015 20:00	320		
Student44	Student84	1	"It appears that you are making good progress on your project. I see where you adjusted your time estimates to re-scope the work to the time you have available. That is good. I did not see that you outlined any problems or questions you were having. Will presume you don't have any. Consequently, I have no recommendations other than to stay the course and look forward to seeing your final results."	10/25/2015 20:17	1448		
Student44	Student22	1	"Wow...I got your submission twice in the same peer feedback review. After a second review, my previous recommendations stand and remain valid!"	10/25/2015 20:43	140	4	"Problem with peer review - read below..... Hi [firstname], I didn't see your first submission apparently - all I got was this: ""Wow...I got your submission twice in the same peer feedback review. After a second review, my previous recommendations stand and remain valid!"" (Sender note: I never saw the first review this student did). Progress report from [firstname] to Team EMOT. 10/26/2015 - this feedback note is from Student22"
Student95	Student11	0	Your progress report seems a little short. Perhaps you could have explained more about setting up firebase or showing what your database objects look like or maybe why you designed the gui the way you did. Perhaps all of that information is in the zip file. I hope so.	10/25/2015 21:08	145		
Student95	Student72	2	"Nicely done! Highly detailed progress report. I have never worked with paper.js, but it looks like a good way to design your game. Keep following you plan. You are doing great."	10/25/2015 21:10	494		
Student95	Student19	1	I think designing the story for a game has got to be terribly difficult. I am glad your mentor can help you out on that. Smart decision to work on another part of the project when the story was giving you trouble. I can't wait to see the game.	10/25/2015 21:18	453		
Student95	Student87	1	"This looks like a good project, and useful. It is almost like a dating app! Anyway, my advice is to get cooking on the gui, even if you have to scrap some or all of it. Getting a feel for the look and feel of the app will give you some insight into where you might want to go with the code. Start with simple stuff and then move on once that works. Good luck and I look forward to seeing your project."	10/25/2015 21:26	365		
Student90	Student5	1	"The GUI design is elegant. Besides that, I'm not sure what input to give the team because I do not know the requirements."	10/25/2015 21:26	531		
Student90	Student86	1	It is helpful to see the schedule to understand the complexity of the project but without knowing a little bit more about the plan it is difficult to give feedback.	10/25/2015 21:35	1277		
Student90	Student63	1	"It would have been nice to have an introduction that explains the goal of the project. After rea[lastname]g the paper, it seems that you are doing an AIT to teach physics. I do not understand, though, the procedure that the ITS uses to see if the student understood the subject"	10/25/2015 21:56	3871		
Student90	Student70	0	"Just like the other papers I read, this one did not have an introduction that would give us an idea what the project is about. The graphics are cute but it is difficult to understand what needs to be done."	10/25/2015 23:05	158		
Student24	Student75	1	Good to know that you are continuing your SAD project. It seems you have made quite a progress with the design of the system and are ready to move to implementation phase. Is the optimization objective still going to be course recommendations (that is what we covered in SAD)? Or are you planning to do variation on main objective for LP program? Also do think about hosting your prototype to some free cloud based web hosting services for getting more feedback as you move to development phase. I think you have made great progress in narrowing down the high level design and Data model schema. Good luck with the project!	10/25/2015 21:43	666		
Student24	Student18	1	"Great project topic.I like the idea, its quite a novel way of capturing student learning process. You seem to have made good progress with the design process by identifying the technology stack and ini[firstname]l project setup. The UI view for survey looks very intuitive and easy to follow. Looking at the list of completed tasks, you are probably ready to deploy the application for further reviewing process. You mentioned that the tool will ""gather data on achievement emotions of their learners"". Is the tool going to provide an aggregated view of this data in some meaningful way that will help Instructors to arrive at some decision for improving users learning process? I was trying to understand how this data will be utilized by the Instructors. But then you might have already covered these kind of question in your proposal. Good luck with the project."	10/25/2015 22:11	1085		
Student24	Student17	1	"Your wire-frame mock ups look clean and does give a high level view of the application workflow. I think you have a general understan[lastname]g of the design structure and layout of the application workflow. Once you move towards Implementation phase you will need to consolidate the data model as the application is highly data driven. You will need to identify the key entities and their relationship to come up with a normalized data model to store the information. I believe creating a robust data model is key to the application which deals with managing huge amount of text data. Also having a normalized data will help with performance when you have to query the data for retrieving hierarchy of posts. I was a little bit confused about the purpose of Course lan[lastname]g page where you refer that ""sections are customizable by the professors/TA�s"". Does it mean that Instructor or TA needs to manage this page for aggregating topics under individual sections? How about students who are used to creating their topics and posting them, do they need to tie it with one of the existing sections OR the application will manage the relationship? I think piazza has been under continues development for a few years now and it has been evolving with feedback it receives from its user base. Any alternate application will need to be very robust in data management and load time performance. Any additional enhancements like chat window and auto suggestions will be welcome."	10/26/2015 19:26	122		
Student24	Student51	2	"By far the best progress report I have reviewed. judging from the prototype screenshots,the design of App looks quite seamless and geared towards the target audience. You guys have done a great job of incorporating the research component in the development process. I think your project has great poten[firstname]l due to involvement of subject matter experts in the field. You guys have achieved much more in 3 weeks time then most other teams I have reviewed. Cant wait to see the finished product."	10/26/2015 21:10	353		
Student94	Student98	1	Since you are behind your original plan you may need a strategy to get caught up or you may need to refine your original proposal to a more achievable goal that your mentor will approve of	10/25/2015 23:09	343		
Student94	Student37	1	"It seems a lot of work has been done but it was difficult to determine how much work was left to be completed. Also, could not determine if you are on track or need to restructure the project for delivery success"	10/25/2015 23:15	792		
Student94	Student43	1	Seems a lot of work has been done. You need to determine how to complete the tasks listed so it does not impact the time required for further implementation	10/25/2015 23:28	1013	5	
Student94	Student13	2	what classification approach is being used so far? How does that impact the result of your analysis? Good job so far	10/25/2015 23:45	475		
Student4	Student74	2	Great idea! It is heartening to see the progress you have been able to make.	10/25/2015 23:52	215		
Student4	Misc3	1	Great idea! Looks like you have made significant progress in 3 weeks. Good luck in mitigating the mentioned challenges	10/25/2015 23:56	165		
Student4	Student56	1	Great progress. Would be exciting to read the papers that you have wrote once they are available on a public platform	10/25/2015 23:59	85

Student13	Student85	1	"I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your review [firstname]. Buil[lastname]g a custom application that will display course material to elementary students sounds like a phenomenal pursuit! I love the rationale that you provided for using RavenDB as a challenge to force you outside of the ASP.NET MVC, C#, N-tier application architecture environment! It sounds like you have made good progress. From what I can see you are implemenataing class processes now. I like your comment that the project has consumed more time than expected. I wonder - do you think this will continue and how much? How much will your final time estimates be impacted and is the project timeline poten[firstname]lly impacted? I love that you have the screenshots done. This shows distinct progress. If you need a tester e-mail me and I would be happy to provide even more feedback (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca). Overall, my biggest questions related to timeline. How is your timeline impacted? And, in terms of what you finished, is this in line with your current timeline? What about requirements? Do you have a firm list of requirements that you know may not be completed but which you are planning for? If no, not an issue! Just thinking ahead. This absolutely looks like a multi period project and I am excited to see how it goes! Good luck overall with everything and be sure to keep in touch should you have any questions! - Nate [lastname]"	10/26/2015 3:12	378	6	Testing volunteers are always helpful!
Student13	Student99	1	"Hi [firstname]. I am really interested in your project which seeks to detect plagiarism on short essays. I like how you set up the issue that you are pursuing and the impact that your work will have on things overall! In terms of your project, the scope seems clear. You will compare a students submitted assignment vs previous. A question that came to mind ... what if all the assignments are plagiarized? How would this impact the results or the predictions? A thought I had since you may have that kind of correlation in there (a person who plagiarizes may have done it before). Also, how many previous assignments do you need in order to detect plagiarism? I see that you are using cosine similarity and readibility metrics. Is there research out there that talks about the successful use of cosing similarity at detecting plagiarized work? Is this also a good characteristic of plagiarized work - term-frequency similarity? Also, project wise, it sounds like you are a tad behind (I am sure that you aren't the only one). YOu wanted to the do readability metrics code and perform the linear regression - but this doesn't sound feasible yet. How is your project plan impacted on this and is your suggestion to complete things in the next couple of days feasible? Does this also impact how much time you will be able to put into your functional front end? I love your trello board. Am just concerned about your schedule as you noted that this readability code and regression code is about 20 hours of work. What happens also if your regression code does not work? Overall, that is my only concern here - schedule & features. I look forward to seeing how things go and encourage you to reach out to me should you have any questions! Cheers! - Nate [lastname] (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	10/26/2015 3:19	448		
Student13	Student8	2	"Hi Chris! I really liked rea[lastname]g your progress report. Starting off with the fact that ""progress has been easier than expected"" is a great place to be in! I am also intrigued around your project scope and goals! Buil[lastname]g a game that helps the Autistic community is a powerful goal! It sounds like, to this point, you haven't got all the variations down on your jumping story. A question for you - how hard does this look to be? The same question has me curious for layouts! I like your callout on the graphics deficiency piece! It is also cool that a student volunteer to help with music! Overall, I didn't have any places where I felt the game you provided was unfair! I clicked on your link and the load time was a little slow - though that seems okay for now! I did get confused as I think I landed on a person and then went to a new level - with all the platforms too high for me! In terms of the coins, I would have loved more. The speed was perfect! And the graphics were just fine! Reminds me of some of the games I used to play in miniclip.com! Loved that soccer game! Overall, take care and good luck! If you need me to test more reach out (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca) and I am happy to do as much testing as you need!

Student13	Student83	1	"Hi Mike! I loved reviewing your progress! It sounds amazing - getting to solve tasks using increasingly complext challenges. As I read your progress so far section, the biggest issue it sounds like it time (or life). I had the same on my own project. I like how you did rescope things for the younger audience. Did this introduce any new significant requirements that might impact your timeline in future? Like, does a younger audience need say more instruction than an older audience? Thanks also for sharing the link on teh tool that you are using! Learning that and tackling the art sound like pressing problems or challenges that you need to pursue! In terms of the feedback, I would switch from the lawn mower to the dirt bike. Lots of folks don't mow their lawns, and I know that dirt bikes, finger boards, and such, are pretty cool right now in the middle to late elementary student group. I am also thinking about the visible player characteristics. I like the thought of ""peering"" onto yourself. That said, I see the concern. I don't have a reco other than to poten[firstname]lly consider a visible player character. That might be way out of scope, but is like the difference of playing a shooter in first person or third person. Good luck and reach out directly if you want more feedback! - Nate [lastname] (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca)"	10/26/2015 3:46	465		
Student92	Student87	1	"It sounds like your past few weeks have been productive. I'm interested to see what your final project is like. I've read http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do Programming Collective Intelligence in the past and I found it to be very accessible and enlightening. You may have come across it already, but I found it VERY helpful in understan[lastname]g how to apply different recommendation engines."	10/26/2015 9:25	756		
Student92	Student81	1	"This an absolutely fascinating field of study. I watched a demo of Hololens during a Microsoft demo and it was mind-blowing. I'm also curious about its applications to education. Regar[lastname]g your assertion about [lastname]'s law. This is a heavily debated topic. Many think that [lastname]'s Law is broken, so this is something I think you should address. I know that Microsoft is releasing some for developers in quarter 1 of 2016. It's unfortunately that it isn't available this semester."	10/26/2015 19:28	472	7	thanks. i will research [lastname]'s Law...
Student92	Student1	1	"Sam, it looks like you're making great progress. As MOOCs become more prevalent, eventually one will have to take a hard look at this problem and try to solve it, so I am glad that you are doing the legwork! My project could make use of some of this great research, so I am eagerly awaiting your research results. One really useful thing to see would be some efforts that some organizations have already tried to address these issues and their fin[lastname]gs, if available. Best of luck. -[firstname]"	10/26/2015 19:36	325	7	
Student92	Student86	1	"It looks like you are chugging along. Gathering live data is difficult so I applaud the strides you guys have already made. I've taught programming to young students myself and have found that it can be quite challenging for both teacher and students. I think gamification is great. I've generally found that the hardest part of this experience is the abstract nature of programming concepts, which are much unlike things they've learned before. Best of luck!"	10/26/2015 19:42	300		
Student1	Student25	1	"Hi [firstname], yes I would include a lot of diagrams and screenshots. Not only does it help us better understand your work, but I've noticed that graders for OMSCS courses generally give better [firstname]s to papers with more visual aids."	10/26/2015 9:58	243		
Student1	Student52	2	"Wow that is a lot of great research on the subject! It is a huge field, and it's smart to narrow your focus to fit the confines of the time left in the course. A very interesting project, I look forward to seeing the results!"	10/26/2015 10:02	301	7	
Student1	Student73	2	"Looks like you've been really getting things done, which is great! Have you considered ad[lastname]g the courses for specialties that have not been created as grayed out or [firstname]ing them as ""pen[lastname]g""?"	10/26/2015 10:07	216		
Student1	Student35	2	"Great breakdown of your timeline and concept. Have you considered any ways that a student might ""game"" the process to show more contribution than they actually have done? For example, more lines of code to do very simple tasks or perhaps making code needlessly complicated to show a higher ranking?"	10/26/2015 10:11	264		
Student8	Student99	1	"It would be definitely be interesting to run this code against all of the essays people have written in this class. One thing I have learned is that back in high school writing some of those essays seemed like such a daunting task... but now I could probably write those essays in a matter of an hour at most. Maybe it was because I was just starting to write, but that definitely was something that I could see contributing to people wanting to cheat. Even in college it still felt harder than it should have. However, once I got into this program I found it fairly easy to write most of the essay's I have had to write.. Maybe this is due to my increase in interest in the topics themselves, I can't really say. Either way it will be interesting to see where this goes."	10/26/2015 10:06	507		
Student8	Student85	1	"This seems like something interesting. I like that, while maybe not finished, it looks fairly clean. The different types of questions is a plus as well. I would be interesting to see how other types of things are added in other than math but in some cases that may not be too hard to have. Another thing that I liked...was the puns.... at least they appear to be puns, the 1 - [lastname] class.... and if not.. then maybe you should keep them..haha. Either way, I also do agree that the more we can give teachers the ability to target struggling students the better in the long run. In general anything that can maximize people's time is valuable in my eyes."	10/26/2015 11:12	1417	5	
Student8	Student7	2	"One of the best things I read in this was, ""Teach them how to learn"". I can't stress enough how important that is, especially with programming. I think too many people say, just do things and you will get better. That doesn't work for everyone and its really not a fair thing to say in general. While for me, iOS learning isn't high on my list, I feel that if a great curriculum has been created, it should be able to duplicated to other languages and what not. Rea[lastname]g your approach is something I really enjoy . In the end, I think too many things are tailored to people who already seem to , get it, as opposed to those who might need a bit more guidance, so this I like."	10/26/2015 12:52	559		
Student8	Student97	1	Something that can help people get jobs is awesome I feel. Overall it seems that you are on pace. I would like to see more descriptions of what is here so I can get a better idea of the whole project.	10/26/2015 13:01	199		
Student9	Student49	1	"There isn't much for me to comment on here. It sounds like a lot of things are happening, but waterfall style - I suppose this kind of write up makes me wonder if enough time is being allocating to validating the idea, vs setting up a lot of IT. It would be a shame if half the project time is spent setting up databases and apache config before testing the actual idea - or maybe all of this is required to even test the idea."	10/26/2015 11:39	542		
Student9	Student16	1	"I'm glad you shared your concerns. Is there a way to test the central value of the idea without writing the whole back-end? E.g. can you build the front-end first and just assume the back end will work? I think there is a lot of value in prototyping a UI/UX to completion, and perhaps less in a fully flushed out back end."	10/26/2015 11:48	230	6	
Student9	Student36	1	"I don't have a lot of context, and I'm not quite sure what I can offer. I like that you are working iteratively - many people are not and it concerns me. It does seem a shame you can't get the data you need from Piazza - I wonder if there are any strings that can be pulled. Is there some other workaround (ask students in the class to gather their own data for you from their own account?). My own metric for my work is - is this something I would demand if I were assigned project X. For instance, I'm interested in developing educational games, but I really don't know much about the current thinking in learning in games, so I'm using this project to study some games I really feel like I learned a lot from - and trying to synthesize that into a working model. Is there a similar approach you can take? Assume you want to build something - what does the report look like that answers the hard questions?"	10/26/2015 21:13	351	5	
Student9	Student78	1	"So this sounds like a neat start - but can you go further with the affect? If you know a student understands addition and subtraction, but gets frustrated with multiplication, can you bring up a lesson on multiplication? If a student has answered 2 X 4 correctly, but fails on 4 x 2, can you bring up the commutative property? I like the simple inputs, but can you devise a system that actually understands why a student is having trouble?"	10/26/2015 21:19	233		
Student45	Student42	1	"The mockup link seems to be broken, i got an error. Other than that, you looks like the team has a good start and has a plan in place to tackle the various components of the project. I also don't see Appendix C in the document."	10/26/2015 12:04	533		
Student45	Student64	2	"This is a great progress report, especially in terms of the fin[lastname]gs. I think the team is doing a great job. Please keep it up. I often come across the point that major issue with students in low-income communities is the lack of parental involvement in their education. It will be great if you can confirm this as a fact in your report by talking to some parents, if possible. Even low-income families have access to TV and internet. Instead of watching TV, they can put on learning games. It will be interesting to see how those parents can be encouraged to be more involved. Are schools making any effort to reach out to such parents and encourage them?"	10/26/2015 12:13	706		
Student45	Student40	1	"When I try to see the videos, I get an error - ""An error occurred, please try again later!"". I am assuming that ""X"" sign means its completed and ""~"" means its still pen[lastname]g, is it a safe assumption? I would have liked to see a bit more details on report, hopefully in next report."	10/26/2015 12:28	251		
Student45	Student80	1	"I played and it worked on my browser, i used Chrome. I am a little confused, i think for a game, its interface is little monotonic and it doesn't feel like I was plying a game. I guess ad[lastname]g more color and stating the no of points I have every time will be more helpful. Overall, you have made great progress! Good job."	10/26/2015 12:36	174	6	trying the game is helpful! sentiment is something I can't simulate. Helpful feedbeck!
Student96	Student34	1	"This is fascinating. I'm curious how the ""optional"" part plays out in the results. For example, it might be the students that go ""above and beyond"" are the ones that will use Peer Feedback and may also get better grades. Perhaps it could be separated out to chart the ones that submitted all Peer Feedback and the ones that answered some as different groups. Anyway, I hope the project goes well. This is a great idea and I can see how it could give immediate feedback to the program."	10/26/2015 12:14	201	5	Clearly gave it some real consideration
Student96	Student55	2	"Wow, great project. Mine hit the reality rocks as well. 1) I would first add the ability to enter my past courses and what I should take next to meet different concentration tracks. 2) I would also add the ability to look at the new courses that are available (and their registered/waitlist numbers even if you have to enter it manually). 3) I would add the ability to rate courses along 3-4 axis such as difficulty, enjoyment, has exams, has teams and display it to people reviewing courses to take. You could maybe also add the ability to enter a grade and/or comment. Then copy in a few reviews from the Google spreadsheet so every course has some data."	10/26/2015 12:18	381		
Student96	Student50	2	Great survey! I'm curious what you can distill out from the data going further. I'll look forward to seeing your final report as there is something of value here.	10/26/2015 12:24	109		
Student96	Student91	1	"It sounds like you picked a very challenging project. I'm curious how it is going. In case it is useful, I often use Selenium as a test environment. It has the ability to remote control browsers for test purposes. Though I don't remember the full details of your project so I may be off base."	10/26/2015 12:26	122		
Student51	Student17	1	Seeing all your courses on one page would be well welcome addition. You use to be able to see that type of thing in the Piazza Phone Apps but they took it away. My main suggestion would be to come up with a way to compare your different lay out ideas with Piazza. Maybe that's as simple as number of clicks it takes to preform something and a list of tasks to compare. Tasks I would consider would be: 1. Ask a Question on an Assigment 2.

Student51	Student71	2	I'm biased but I like this project. Best of Luck	10/26/2015 21:32	85	7	
Student51	Student3	1	"First off, looks like your making great progress since the last time I reviewed one of your submissions. In terms of your questions, the style of bulleted list depends a lot , not seeing yours specifically I don't lean either way. On the Intro I would suggest to be just long enough to cover the five w's. Who, What, Why and possibly How and Where and When. Non Technical Pictures are probably good, Technical depends on your audience. In terms of your task 3 section, have you considered comparing it to something they might know? Maybe a comparison table with things like Bus/Fleet operations, Buil[lastname]g Maintenance, Food Service or even athletics. Hopefully most administrations would under stand the importance of not having just teachers do those type of things."	10/26/2015 21:35	649	7	Interesting. Comparing IT to other similar school services is a helpful idea.
Student51	Student75	1	"You seem to have a well documented design for what I'm assuming is a class registration system. However with out your proposal and any of the user story, its hard to give you any useful feedback. You do seem to be on track for your Project Milestones."	10/26/2015 21:32	1902		
Student85	Student41	1	"Pretty cool, [firstname] - you're working with some technologies I've always wanted to try out! A question that comes to mind immediately is where does the list of SMEs come from and how they are related to a given course? I hate to say this, but have you considered falling back to email as the communications mechanism instead of SMS? I know it's so 1990s, but the availability of a Subject line as well as inclu[lastname]g the thread content in the message would help with your issue linking questions and answers. From the SME perspective, it would also benefit me as I could set up a custom address to use in my SME role that's distinct from the rest of my life (or even an address per course I'm SMEing). Good luck!"	10/26/2015 12:47	768		
Student85	Student97	1	"[firstname], it sounds like you have a solid foundation for your project and are following a good plan. I was wondering, what standard/format will you use to present your course material to the learner? If you haven't considered SCORM or the Tin Can API, you might consider looking at those options. Do you plan to require a login? If so, can I ""log in with Facebook"" or do I have to create an account with your site? Another question is, what are the creden[firstname]ls behind learnsecurity.co's instructors? And lastly, your site might benefit from a native English speaker's review, if it is to support an English-speaking audience."	10/26/2015 13:06	797		
Student85	Student7	1	"Hi Ben. Are going to be writing your own content for the training topics? Or are you provi[lastname]g more of curated link service? Sorry, it's not clear from this paper alone. It would be really cool if your site could be the Swift version of JSFiddle!"	10/26/2015 16:12	238		
Student85	Student10	2	"This is a very nice project, [firstname] - good work! As a user of the application, my request would be to implement ""Logon with Facebook"", et al, so I don't have to establish yet another account/password. Good luck!"	10/26/2015 16:17	265		
Student71	Student56	1	"Look at it as if you are a lawyer. A lawyer will anticipate the arguments of the opponent and prepare the case as such. You need to play devil's advocate on the arguments for standardized testing as well as what the supporters of it might see as flaws in your plan. Play the defense though, not the prosecutor. Give enough reasonable doubt in their case that your case can be considered as a plausible alternative. This isn't about being right, it is about continuing the discussion and offering plausible alternatives. We don't grow our knowledge without questions."	10/26/2015 12:04	4052		
Student71	Misc3	2	This is a fascinating project but kind of out of areas of expertise. I do like your idea of pushing some of the ladder logic iteration to the UI via a web worker to deal with threa[lastname]g issues.	10/27/2015 15:31	1488		
Student71	Student60	1	"Great idea and good architectural approach. I would do the external auth. You may also (and perhaps you have) want to consider AI algorithms for aid in selection of study buddies. For example, if a student doesn't select certain suggested buddies, perhaps the system can use information about those buddies to tweak the student's preferences."	10/27/2015 15:55	13118

Student77	Student36	0	"I think this is a good summary of the work that's been done, but I would love to hear about (even intermediate!) results from this work. For example, you've been sen[lastname]g out a survey--any ini[firstname]l fin[lastname]gs that surprised you? Anything that you didn't expect in the data? Additionally, your questions are very mentor-specific: I can't really tell you whether you can adjust your focus and timeline (as this is an agreement that is between you and your mentor!). I would have liked to help with questions you had specifically aimed at your peers."	10/26/2015 14:48	174	5	
Student77	Student53	1	"Sounds like you've made some good progress, but I would caution (as someone buil[lastname]g an app as well!) that the development process may take longer than you plan and I'm surprised you haven't started buil[lastname]g out an app from the mocks you shared. My suggestion/recommendation would be to do less requirements gathering and dive into the code! Launch and iterate based on feedback (i.e.: switch to agile methodology instead of waterfall). I like that you shared the interactive mockups, my one suggestion for this product would be to make the ""dashboard"" view more than just a table. Imagine you have a class of 35+ students, as many classrooms do. Getting all the data presented in a table with no differen[firstname]ting way to view/highlight/filter stats might render the product not beneficial for teachers."	10/26/2015 14:52	179		
Student77	Student9	1	"This sounds like a fun undertaking--playing video games for hours a week? I should have done this for the class :)! All kid[lastname]g aside, I do think that the games you outlined seem compelling (I myself am more drawn to the flight game). It's interesting that your proposing games that have different goals (one is to teach something relatively technical like aeronautics, the other's learning goals is around private vs. mass fishing, the environment etc). In terms of your final project, it might be worth categorizing the type of goals a game can have (technical, social, etc) and discuss common themes or architectures that each of those ""types"" should contain (i.e., technical goals should always include XYZ, where social-oriented games should include ABC)."	10/26/2015 14:48	884		
Student77	Student16	1	"Sorry to hear that you're struggling [lastname]. I am also buil[lastname]g a mobile app and figured I could share some learnings to help you get a MVP (minimum viable product) up and running quickly: * Scope back and set clear limits: Instead of doing Android AND iOS, just choose one. Since you have a Mac, using Xcode allows for super quick iOS development (leverage the storyboard!) and Swift is a very easy language to pick up (similar to python in its readability, with splashes of C ;)). * Use a tool like Parse (parse.com) for your backend--they have great documentation for integrating with variable platforms (iOS included, but Android and JS included). All you have to do is set up the databases within their easy-to-use UI and voila! Much easier than buil[lastname]g it out yourself and then writing an API to handle requests and queries. * Go agile: don't try to build the entire app + functionality in one-go. Choose a very bare-bones v1 of the app and build that. Then build ontop of it each week. For example, I'm buil[lastname]g an app that allows you to share content with your classmates (articles, webpages, etc) and you can upvote, comment, interact with those articles on a mobile app. The first version of my app had only a tableview of dummy data: proof that I could get it working! Then I tackled populating the table with real data. Then ad[lastname]g the ability to like/comment on it. THEN making the UI pretty! Let me know if you have any questions (Student77). Happy to expand on any of the ideas above!"	10/26/2015 14:48	1294	6	
Student93	Student70	1	"I think you have made a good progress and the mockup is very lovely. The report seemed very short to me, but I don't think it is missing any crucial information. I would have been interesting in seeing what challenges have you faced and how did you address them. (and btw, the appendix C with design specification is not available)"	10/26/2015 15:30	368		
Student93	Student82	1	"Hi [firstname], I really liked your progress update -- everything what I would have asked for: summary of what the project is, some challenges in the implementation, scope [lastname]es and questions. Really it was great and very compactly delivered (the list technologies used in the prototype is intimidating :)) Regar[lastname]g your questions...no such luck. I was not able to access your cite. I was able to submit my email address to receive an url, however no information was sent to me. Ping me in the discussions here if you want me to retry in case the login was temporarily unavailable."	10/26/2015 15:36	1558	7	
Student93	Student63	1	"Hi Yi-Chen, I am not big on online games (even if it is for educational purpose), so I am not sure if my feedback is helpful. BUT... I do love physics and I think you could do a lot of interesting stuff with it. I recommend picking a variety of activities as a good examples to explain the concepts of physics. For example, it is very typical to choose a basketball game since it explains the trajectories and kinematic equations very well. How about trying something crazier? Flying Trapeze? Acrobatics? Dancing? Also, there are too many equations on the same page. If you are targeting kids, they will get distracted very fast. Also is there any feedback in the system? Sorry, I do not have any technical feedback on the game design. It looks good what you have done so far! Student93"	10/28/2015 16:53	31		
Student93	Student90	1	"Hi [firstname], I like the idea of handling this project as a proposal to a software design and I really like the subject of your research. My focus is also on helping individuals with disabilities, however the area is drastically different. So, the idea is great...But I wasn't able to see the connection between holons and your concept of designing a software to aid children with the help of music therapy. In my mind, these two pieces remained largely disconnected (it could also be due to the fact of not being fully aware of your conceptual proposal). I am hoping the trailer would clarify a lot of things for me. Meanwhile my only suggestions is to describe your progress in larger detail and not necessarily for peers benefit only(although that is important). Very often I find gap in my reasoning as I dive into the details."	10/28/2015 20:54	711	7	
Student86	Student39	2	"Great tool and I am sure it would be useful to high school students. Though we only are given few weeks for developing this app, your UI mockups looks professional. Architecture/design explanations look great. Good luck."	10/26/2015 16:24	217		
Student86	Student48	1	Good progress you have made so far. The survey idea look neat and I am sure you will be able to gather some useful data from the survey. Good luck.	10/26/2015 16:30	111		
Student86	Student44	1	"I am seeing only the task list and I do not see any other write-up of the research details. so it is difficult for me to rate your progress on your research. By looking at the task list completion, You have made considerable progress -- Good luck."	10/26/2015 16:34	719		
Student86	Student5	1	Great progress on data model and rest api designs. I would have liked to see the full feature list and what is completed and what is yet to be done to get an idea about the entire progress. Great Job. All the best.	10/26/2015 16:46	193		
Student43	Student8	1	"Hi Chris, nice work so far. Not sure I have anything to add to your content, but I did do a little testing of your game. I think things are good from your questions. However, I did notice a couple things: - when I landed on a person, it went to the second screen, not sure if that is expected - on the second screen, the trampoline didn't work - on the first screen, when I reached the end, my character then went nuts scrolling and jumping back and forth, eventually en[lastname]g up in a loop of ""bouncing"" between to people sprites"	10/26/2015 16:31	661		
Student43	Student98	1	"I could see how this information could be useful but I do wonder if some parents would be unwilling to provide all this information. I think you should also include questions about family structure, like how many kids (b[lastname]ers/sisters) and ages. What is the student's birth order within the siblings. Perhaps also some additional personal interest questions, like is there a subject you are interested in that the school doesn't currently offer, etc."	10/26/2015 16:42	449		
Student43	Student13	1	"I don't know if this would have any bearing on or addition to your research but since you have data on video watching, does that include what time of day a person watches the videos (in respect to a student's timezone)? Could you infer/determine if someone is watching during the day (while at work) or at home at night, and/or during the weekday or weekends. Does that imply any difference in level of focus and correlate to any differences in performance?"	10/26/2015 16:49	476		
Student43	Student83	1	"I think your project is really interesting. As I understand it, It's basically teaching root cause analysis through a game. And that is a skill that I think even many adults are not that good at. You mentioned the lawnmower and I too would question that as one of the scena[lastname], only b/c I could see that it could then inadvertently encourage a kid to then do something similar with a real lawnmower and hurt themselves. Maybe not a valid concern, but that is the first thing I thought of. Maybe another item could be determining why a printer isn't printing?"	10/26/2015 16:57	821		
Student28	Student72	1	"Looks like you made good progress on the project. Since this is targeted for kids, do you have any plan to involve some at user acceptance testing phase? It should be fun to see how a kid may use the app. Good luck with the project!"	10/26/2015 17:18	391	5	Liked your comment about using kids in the user acceptance phase.
Student28	Student100	1	"Looks like your team made good progress. It would've been nice to include some screen shots, even incomplete to showcase what you've done. Keep up the good work!"	10/26/2015 17:25	119		
Student28	Student81	0	Looks like you submitted a draft document instead of progress report.	10/26/2015 17:28	124	6	that is true
Student28	Student95	2	"Wow, [firstname], this is very cool! I have been wanting to build a robot since taking AI for Robotics class, but only gotten time to tried one of those simple prepackaged solar power one. Looking forward to seeing your end product. Good luck with it!"	10/26/2015 17:30	272		
Student61	Student6	0	"Summary - please state why linac training with actual device may not be safe (I know why but not many other folks may not identify what may be dangerous about practicing with a linear accelerator) The past three weeks - I have worked with Matlab in the past and found it very forgiving. I assume you have had issues with a GUI, but you refer to it as UI only. Please try looking for GUI implementation, unless I am not interpreting this paragraph correctly. Upcoming schedule - Who are the training staff? No problem if you cant say. Sounds like a great project! Looks like you have had issues (as I have too) and you are in the process of working around to make it happen! Rock on!"	10/26/2015 19:35	683	6	"Yeah, great feedback. I should have explained things out a lot more."
Student61	Student26	0	Wish I had a complete summary of tasks... Really interested in how you are using [lastname]trap and angularJS (no code snippets??? :(((((). I really would have liked to see if what you have done so far has [lastname]ed your ini[firstname]l assumptions. Sounds like you are well on the way to have a prototype product and I look forward to seeing more!	10/26/2015 19:47	535	6	"Yes I agree; there should have been lots of resources but seem unfortunately those didn't make it to this pdf. Also, I see the link to the demo site is in the progress report; on there you can do inspect element and preview the site."
Student61	Student101	0	"I am very concerned that you are still awaiting approval from both contacts. Do you have a back up plan if they do not get approval in a timely manner? It was not clear to me the INTENT of your questions in the questionnaire( this may be because I did not have your ini[firstname]l hypothesis or ini[firstname]l proposal). I like that you have a backup for pen and paper and suggest you add a phone questionnaire, or even mobile questionnaire as I have found some people do not associate their cell phone with internet or technology. Perhaps a test message that takes them to a mobile friendly survey site?"	10/26/2015 19:56	610	7	
Student61	Student58	0	"First - I am soooo excited to get to see your progress report!!!!! Second - I would like to see a rehash of your ini[firstname]l hypothesis. And maybe a side by side on anything you expected that was different? Perhaps a what you expected, what you got, what is different (if any?), and why you think it if different column? Third - Could you extract the data through [lastname]scripts instead of manually viewing data? Last - Do you have a mechanism for abnormal performance? Example: I would like to take a class in the spring yet I know I will not have a readily available internet connection during April and May. If I take a class and take a hit for that (due to work) how would that figure into you hypothesis and data set?"	10/26/2015 20:06	1503		
Student10	Student26	1	Sounds like you are well under way and have a good sense of what you have to work on. AngularJS and [lastname]trap make for a powerful pair. Do you have a good plan for testing it?	10/26/2015 19:55	268	6	"Let me say, I know the tools i need to test it"
Student10	Student41	1	"Twilio should give you the sender To/From inside the request when it posts to your server on receiving a message. You should be able to use this to associate with the proper ID. Then in Twilio you'll associate the phone number with this URL on your account page. In terms of associating a question with an answer - I don't think you want to do that, since users won't strictly reply to messages in order. So it probably makes sense to leave your model loose, and sort later on things like time."	10/26/2015 20:00	626		
Student10	Student61	1	"This sounds like a really nice idea. If I understand correctly, you're trying to automatically figure out how much programming knowledge is used in a given course. You might want to parse free text too - for example, a course might discuss specific algorithms and so on. Also, have you put any thought into how you will distinguish between courses introducing new concepts and ones that expect that knowledge coming into the course? Anyway, sounds like you're making good progress - good luck."	10/26/2015 20:10	278	6	"Yes I have thought about that but it is really beyond what I can accomplish in the time frame. I think I need to reiterate that due to time and other factors I want to limit the ini[firstname]l implementation to a syntax only approach. Would love to classify specific algorithms, just not feasible right now."
Student10	Student6	1	"Great - I remember reviewing one of your earlier documents, and it still sounds like a great idea. I'm glad that you are taking the direct approach in tackling this, and it sounds like you really understand the problem. Good call cutting features to focus on the core. Best of luck."	10/26/2015 20:15	489	4	
Student100	Student19	0	Sorry. Not too much to say regar[lastname]g a progress report. Sounds like you've got an interesting project and that you are making some good technical strides. Good luck getting past your writer's block.	10/26/2015 20:50	586		
Student100	Student81	0	"Was expecting this to be a 500 word progress report rather than a draft of your paper. Not really sure what's yours and what's copy/paste from sources. As this is an academic paper, you may wish to avoid informal phrases and conjecture."	10/26/2015 21:00	950	7	Thanks I will look at revising accor[lastname]gly
Student100	Student95	0	Wow. You've made a ton of progress on this. Can't wait to see the final products.	10/26/2015 21:16	1128		
Student100	Student72	0	"Was thinking this was just supposed to be the 500 word status report. Regardless, looks as though you are making good progress. I think the move to Cordova was a wise one. Not sure about paper.js. Great animation and vector library. But I don't know if it supports multi-touch. It might be able to be hacked to do so, but I'd imagine that you'd want multi-touch support. Even if a kid only uses one finger (i.e., you don't want to enable shape rotation), you'd still want to be able to tolerate a second or third finger or thumb being on the screen while the ""main"" finger drags. By default, the mouse events just pick the first (or most recent) touch. Might be a usability issue. EaselJS might be an alternative. Check out http://fabianirsara.com/2014/09/30/multitouch-gesture-[lastname]sformations-with-easeljs/"	10/26/2015 22:43	48	6	Appreciated [firstname]'s feedback on multi-touch. I'll add that to my test plan right away. :)
Student7	Student6	1	It looks like you are working hard and making good progress toward your goal. It sounds like you are learning a lot about Matlab as you create your UI.	10/26/2015 21:03	176	4	
Student7	Student10	1	"I like your project idea of an environment to practice Chinese. You have accomplished a lot over the past few weeks: authentication, database setup, UI styling. I like the UI of the web pages. It seems like you are in good shape to deliver the project by the end of the semester."	10/26/2015 21:10	949		
Student7	Student41	1	"It sounds like you are making good progress on the project. I don't have much experience with SMS messaging servers. Sen[lastname]g the ID of the question as part of the answer text as you mentioned is the only way I can think of to associate an answer with a question purely through SMS. This is probably outside the scope of your project, but with an iOS push notification (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html) you would be able to associate metadata like the question ID with the answer message. The drawback would be that you need an iOS app to be able to use Apple's push notification service and the expert answering the question would need an iPhone or iPad."	10/26/2015 21:25	1189		
Student7	Student61	1	"You have done a lot of good planning over the first few weeks. As you mentioned, I think your biggest obstacle will be the amount of time you will need to spend watching videos and listening for key terms."	10/26/2015 21:45	2499	4	Wish I could get some feedback on my UML.
Student29	Student17	1	"I did not see your original proposal, so I don't know if you are on track or not. I would probably use this in conjunction with Piazza until I felt confident navigating in it. Piazza is overwhelming, but it has the option to group posts by unread, following, categories, etc. Can you incorporate that into Aperta? I think if it offered the same ""deep dive"" possibilities as Piazza (meaning you can follow a whole post all the way down, have email notifications, etc), it would be a viable product. Looks good."	10/26/2015 21:18	277		
Student29	Student24	2	"Very good progress. I was unable to see the original proposal, but looks like you are tracking well ahead of schedule. I liked the extensive breakdown of accomplishments and what remains to be done. I tried the URL, but it did not work for me - no biggie. Looking forward to seeing the finished product."	10/26/2015 21:29	249	6	Thanks for encouragement [firstname].
Student29	Student18	1	"I liked the detailed breakdown of what has been accomplished. Since I did not see the original proposal, it would have been good to say how you are tracking against your plan."	10/26/2015 21:34	161		
Student29	Student51	2	"I would buy this app when it's done. I can't suggest any improvements, very good job. I like that you gave a detailed description of your status, described the conference with the Professor (and the upcoming conference), testing, and even the challenges. First rate project all around."	10/26/2015 21:36	303		
Student83	Student97	1	"It sounds like your project is progressing well. I'm surprised that learnsecurity.co was available as a domain, nice find. This feedback isn't necessarily related to the progress report, but - do you have a plan for keeping the curriculum up to date with this platform? Security is a domain that moves so quickly that the content will need to be consistently updated. I thought about this because the progress report mentions guidance from OWASP, but I'm certain that guidance is updated frequently."	10/26/2015 21:49	1328		
Student83	Student8	1	"Wow, it is great to see a functional game already. It took me a couple attempts to get to the end of the first level, but I was able to make it with 25 coins. It looks really good already, but here are a few things I noticed: - It can be frustrating to not be able to jump up through platforms and especially trampolines (typically in a platformer the player can jump up through platforms, while it isn't ""realistic"" it really improves flow) - The trampoline mechanics felt like they could use tuning. Of course, I'm spoiled by Mario's flawless trajectories that have been honed by decades of master craft. - Near the end of the level, if the player is running along the top platform, and continues with full momentum where the platform drops a little, the player lands right on someone. That one may be helpful to tweak to avoid frustration there. I think the movement of the character was fast enough, but I felt that the character's jumping mechanics and momentum could use a little tuning. I don't think there were too many sprites or coins for a typical level, but it may be better to start out the first level with fewer. Great work, and good luck for the future."	10/26/2015 22:11	1133		
Student83	Student99	1	"Given that the back end is mostly (probably completely by now) complete, it looks like you are making great progress. Have you been able to test the effectiveness of the detection engine yet? It would be great to see how accurate it is. Unfortunately, the submission attachments didn't come through with the PDF for peer review, so I'm not able to look at the controllers you requested feedback on. Good luck as the project continues."	10/26/2015 22:30	887		
Student83	Student85	1	"It looks like you have made quite a bit of progress. I think getting the styling and layout right will be a key determinant for adoption and success of this project, so it is good that you are buil[lastname]g in a flexible tool like Boostrap to handle that. Good luck with the ongoing project."	10/26/2015 22:45	759	5	
Student52	Student28	2	"iReady Team, Great work! I�ve reviewed a couple papers for iReady previously and have enjoyed rea[lastname]g about your project and helping contribute any ideas I had at that time. Firstly, nice presentation on the structure of your progress report. It flowed well and was easy to read. The frontend site looks good and clean so far. I think it�s a good idea that you have designed it such that it is, as you stated, flexible and extendible so that it is dynamically populated and could poten[firstname]lly be used for any set of courses that fit into the model. Buil[lastname]g a base template like this will hopefully allow other course instructors and/or TA�s to quickly build the necessary data set for each specific course. The referenced screenshots help me visualize what you were referring to regar[lastname]g any course could be used for this model. In regards to your questions/challenges, I wish I could offer you something at this time. I have taken a mental note of these challenges and will be sure to share some insight on any helpful information I come across. I look forward to hearing and seeing more about iReady!"	10/26/2015 23:02	1038	6	
Student52	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], Great explanation on the frontend and backend portions of your OMSCS Advisor. It sounds like you�re moving in the right direction and making good progress so far. I tried accessing the https://omscs-advisor.herokuapp.com/setup link you referenced in the paper but it generated �Heroku | No such app� page. I�ll take your word for it regar[lastname]g the courses and specializations dropdown for now. ;-) Regar[lastname]g your questions, I�ve listed some thoughts that I hope will help. Specializations: Could you view the on-campus version of the MS CS program to build out the specialization course data sets? I assume the on-campus versions will be much more thorough and may serve as a road-map for what the OMSCS specializations will evolve into. Here�s a link to the GT on-campus MS CS specializations- http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/masters/computer-science/specializations. UI: I�m not able to provide any feedback on the UI since the link provided was not working at this time. I tried the courses and specializations links as well, but no luck. Looking great so far and I�m excited to see the final product!"	10/26/2015 23:20	755		
Student52	Student35	1	"Great layout for your progress report! It was easy and enjoyable to read through the progress of your project and quickly view the tasks you�ve completed and those that are scheduled for a later week. The list of metrics to be used with the contribution analysis tool already seemed extensive and I am unable to think of any suggested additions to contribute. You mentioned single sign-on authentication integration with CAS, the open source project behind login.gatech.edu. I�m curious if you plan to integrate SSO with the login.gatech.edu site, or were you just simply referencing that it uses CAS? Other than that, the functional requirements and test lists looked thorough and fully accounting at this time. Great work and I look forward to seeing more about your project later in the course!"	10/26/2015 23:33	739		
Student52	Student25	1	"Hi [firstname], Interesting project title and area of research! I haven�t seen any other students in the Educational Technology course approach this field of research up to this point, so it�ll be very interesting to learn more about your project in particular and the results that you come up with. I also haven�t read many students that are working on the research paper portion for this course either and had me slightly concerned if I was the only student pursuing that path, so thanks for affirming that is not the case. In regards to your challenge on organizing your research paper, I would strongly recommend looking at other examples, which it sounds like you may have a lot of already. Use that general framework to layout your paper. Build a story, much like what we did earlier in this course where we had to create an elevator pitch. If you build a story and create a supportive case for your topic, then the rest should fall into place with piecing the necessary information together to make the paper flow. Regar[lastname]g the diagrams and screenshots, I think it could benefit your case to provide this sort of additional data. Diagrams are helpful to demonstrate the connection process for students accessing a remote system, especially for someone that might not have direct experience in remote solutions like you are proposing. I like the idea of screenshots as well, but that�s because I am a visual person. If you include diagrams and screenshots, paired with the technical details of your research, then you could cover your bases better perhaps. Hope this helps and great work so far! I look forward to seeing more about this project when it is �polished�!"	10/26/2015 23:46	575		
Student63	Student70	1	I think it is a good idea to demonstrate more activities than the vocabulary in this prototype of ITS. I like the UI shown in the mockup which is simple and attractive to target user. Keep on good work.	10/26/2015 22:58	1306		
Student63	Student86	1	"I think it is a good idea to put it on the piazza. For me, I am a self-learner. I learn programming from youtube. Maybe you can check out few popular teaching example there."	10/26/2015 23:20	524		
Student63	Student5	2	There is an unoffi[firstname]l review for different courses. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zJp3Bu2Rb4DRpHLYL2r4nZ210Y2u8eFY7xgQxO4mq7o/edit#gid=1667313482 I think this will be helpful for iReady.	10/27/2015 0:23	47		
Student63	Student48	1	It would be better that author can provide the survey along with this progress report. So I can get a better idea of this project.	10/27/2015 0:24	1139		
Student34	Student9	1	"My feeling is that the flight simulator style is intuitively more like something that should be achievable in a fairly condensed period of time, and still educational. Plus, people love buil[lastname]g stuff (as kerbal space program does demonstrate). I feel like the number of factors that will come into play in the fishing approach will make the whole thing too complex, and make it easy to end up with something so muddled that it doesn't really get any lessons across."	10/27/2015 2:12	212		
Student34	Student46	1	"I'd be willing to try the game either way. I already have a basic understan[lastname]g of binary, so I'm not useful as an example of someone trying to learn binary from scratch. Still, I'd probably focus on buil[lastname]g up the tutorial rather than trying to add extra minigames. Better to try to make the core idea succeed before worrying about too much else. It does seem like you should be able to fulfill an interesting educational need, though."	10/27/2015 2:43	1100		
Student34	Student77	1	"I could definitely see using this. CCA in particular has a lot of people who feel they need more resources than what the course itself offers, and we don't currently have a system to track and store extra resources. If it grows enough, I think you'll need functionality to let people rate content, report offensive content, and for it to perhaps learn which person's submissions are likely to be valuable and should be prioritized on the viewing list."	10/27/2015 3:02	171		
Student34	Student53	1	I suspect that synonyms and an[firstname]ms and that kind of thing as concepts are probably a little sophisticated for a kid who's still at the level of trying to identify a giraffe anyway. It's probably better to stick with core vocabulary itself and try to do very very well with that.	10/27/2015 3:05	254		
Student58	Student45	1	Looks like everything is coming along nicely. I'm looking forward to giving this a try at the end of the semester.	10/27/2015 10:17	412		
Student58	Student80	1	"Hi Student80, good work so far. I tried playing vs the computer and the core components seem to work (chrome). I think the behaviors may be more interesting if there was some sort of connection to the other player, maybe have them answer some survey questions so the other player can draw conclusions about them before game starts. It could also be fake information generated to better serve as a control to see how it impacts behavior."	10/28/2015 11:07	10		
Student58	Student40	1	"Hi [firstname], Next time you might want to include a small summary of your project and it's goals in the progress report, I don't think I've reviewed your papers before so I'm not entirely sure what your focus is. Staying on schedule can be challenging (I'm a bit behind too) so hopefully you can get back on track."	10/28/2015 11:10	211		
Student58	Student64	1	Looks like your research is coming along nicely. The examples of the responses and how they're influencing your research is helpful in getting a sense of the progress you're making. Do the you need to find additional interview subjects to make up for those that are unable to participate?	10/28/2015 11:13	293		
Student66	Student91	1	"Sounds like you're making good progress, it was a little difficult for me to grasp how far along you are because I wasn't sure of the long-term goal for your project. It sounds like you were able to handle a difficult technical patch though which is always nice. How sophisticated do you plan to make the AI for this project? I found drawing a physical diagram of the system architecture really helped me to understand all of the different pieces of data that would flow between the components. Might help you if you find your scope is continuously expan[lastname]g."	10/27/2015 10:56	547		
Student66	Student50	2	"Very cool, I'm a bit of a data nut myself so I really appreciated all of the graphs. It seems like you've made quite a bit of progress. I was a bit unsure of whether your goal was to create a report to explain the trends or if it was to simply propose solutions to the attrition. I think gathering more data would be useful though, given the limited timeline of this project, I am not sure whether it is worth dedicating more resources to. (It would be interesting to see whether people's reports of stress and overwhelmed-ness increase over the course of the semester though haha). Great work, best of luck going forward!"	10/27/2015 11:32	11516		
Student66	Student96	1	"I really appreciated the summary of the overall objective as well as the screenshots showing your progress. You'd be surprised how many people did not include that :D. Your idea of first creating a control panel which people frequently traffic and then slowly incorporating communal aspects into that space really resonated with me. I think you've done well cultivating the beginnings of a community. The next question is what sort of features besides the discussion forum are you planning on ad[lastname]g? You may find that, the more features you add, the faster the community grows. Random sidenote, I was a bit confused on what you meant by encouraging people to ""share code in a way that respects their professional obligations"". Is that IP-related or something else? I've always thought that people have done pretty well by themselves censoring their own code so you may not have to worry about that."	10/27/2015 14:44	707	6	
Student66	Student55	1	"Entertaining read, this was well-written. I think I reviewed your project earlier in the semester and it seems like you are making good progress. As a poten[firstname]l user of your tool, the two most important features for me are: - Accurate estimates of effort for each course (hours/week, # of exams, etc.) - Measuring Progress Towards a Given Specialization (or two) The latter of those has been particularly trying. I find myself doing a lot of clicking trying to plan ahead for coming semesters. The fact that half the OMSCS courses are unavailable online makes it even more difficult. I wanted to pursue a Machine Learning specialization but had to hedge my bet by doing Interactive Intelligence courses in case they didn't release enough Machine Learning courses in time for graduation. In addition to that use case, if people are not sure what specialization they want to pursue, seeing what courses can be applied to multiple specializations would be really useful. I really think the planning is the most important part of this project but that's just my two cents. Best of luck!"	10/27/2015 14:56	956		
Student36	Student29	1	"The content of the paper is generally good. I would say two things to look at: meshing it together so it looks like one voice, and formatting the paper into distinct sections. The table needs some formatting as well"	10/27/2015 11:17	86		
Student36	Student78	2	"This had the formatting that other papers lacked. It also has diagrams and good explanations. I would say more analysis of drawings would give a better flow, but this is good!"	10/27/2015 11:19	57		
Student36	Student49	1	"Your explanations are on point. Not quite sure what the project subject is, but the tools are all laid out in away that I can understand the architecture."	10/27/2015 11:20	70		
Student36	Student59	1	"I can't speak to 1/2/3, but here are a few ideas: http://www.python-course.eu/text_classification_python.php http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html and of course: http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html"	10/27/2015 11:21	146	5	
Student67	Student38	1	"Hi [firstname], I am glad that your project will not be affected by you having to attend the Grace Hopper Convention which I assume must have been awesome to experience. As far as pulling together multiple languages under one, I am all for it and as you mentioned will make it easier to maintain. In fact, my project is also written under one language (JavaScript) and avoided using other languages like Python or Ruby with the hope that my project can get picked up by future students (if I decided to focus on something else after the semester is over). Overall, great job so far, good luck!"	10/27/2015 13:01	563	6	Appreciate the feedback.
Student67	Student65	1	"Hi guys, Great job on the progress report. I think your project is coming along quite nicely and I like the layout a lot, clean and simple. I am also using the Angular framework (has cut down on my development quite a bit in regards to setting up the views, passing around data, etc). I have never used Stormpath for authentication but I think I might give it a shot (their docs are quite nice and support a number of platforms I use). Good luck and can�t wait to see what you all end up with at the of the semester!"	10/27/2015 13:21	84	6	
Student67	Student21	1	"Hi guys, I think your project is coming along quite nicely. In regards to measuring the effectiveness, I would suggest to give a couple of folks in our class access to your app and let them start giving you feedback immediately on how useful it is to them. A lot of us are about to sign up for courses, so this tool would be handy at right about now :) Anyway, I like the progress, the idea, and can�t wait to test iReady! Good luck!"	10/27/2015 13:24	993		
Student67	Student66	1	"Hi Tim, I like the idea of your project and found the display of your app quite interesting. I am not too clear how the �final� view will look like but definitely agree that going the web-based route will allow for you app to scale. Good job on the progress and can�t wait to see what you come up with at the end!"	10/27/2015 13:41	505		
Student11	Student98	0	The main issue I see here is students doing the data entry. I'd look towards integrating with a LMS or having teacher's input them as part of gra[lastname]g. I think it looks to be pretty simple co[lastname]g wise so you should be able to catch up quickly.	10/27/2015 13:20	232		
Student11	Student94	0	"Looks like you're making good progress and it's good to see that you've pivoted away from the original framework early. Have you checked paperJS compatibility with Cordova? Additionally, is there any consideration for a color blind version?"	10/27/2015 13:24	208		
Student11	Student37	0	"Good luck! You guys seem to have one of the more ambitious projects I've reviewed regar[lastname]g the implementation details. The virtual box + guacomole instances were the biggest risk items, I thought, but it looks like you guys are staying ahead of that."	10/27/2015 13:29	171		
Student11	Student43	0	You appear on track. My one piece of feedback is to not get too caught up in making it look pretty and just focus on functioning correctly.	10/27/2015 13:32	201	5	
Student2	Student90	1	"Darn -- I wish peer reviewers were able to look at the deliverable attachments! I'll feel really silly if there is and I'm missing it. In any event, I think you have a really cool project premise. I'm not 100% clear on how the holon network relates to the music aspect. Is the course matter music based, and then the ITS is a separate agent utilizing the holon network? I'm sure these are things that were well explained by your past deliverables. Interesting structure for your project; it sounds like you'll be designing a full application and developing an MVP (minimum viable product). I think that's a really smart approach, considering you'll be integrating a fair amount of research as well. But, be careful not to forgot about development when you're working on design. I think that really fluid design is enabled by an understan[lastname]g of your development tools. And, structurally, you have to make sure your intended architecture is something accomplishable. Looking forward to your report out! [firstname]"	10/27/2015 14:02	636	7	This feedback has been the most helpful I have ever received!!
Student2	Student74	2	"Easily the best progress I've seen so far. The only team, but still -- nice work so far! It sounds like you were very fortunate with your professor contacts; particularly with your new alpha testers! It also sounds like you've been given some great feedback. I don't have too much to say, but I'll give one note on developing with feedback; even when you're consulting experts, you need to take feedback with a grain of salt. Even if they suggest a really worthy addition, its development could distract from more important functionality and obfuscate the product. Ultimately as the developer/product manager/owner all rolled into one, it's your job to distinguish what is and isn't important for your customers. Looking forward to your final product, [firstname]"	10/27/2015 14:13	518		
Student2	Student93	1	"Really interesting project. Somewhat confusing for a first-time-reader, but I can say that it's one of the most appropriately scoped research oriented projects I've read thus far. What you're exploring truly reads like the topic of an accomplishable and well-formed paper for this class. Unfortunately I don't have too much constructive feedback for you! Which is rare. So, instead I'll just say I've done a fair amount of Python based analytics (for work and classes) and if you ever need someone to bounce something off of, feel free to contact me. Looking forward to your paper! [firstname] Student2"	10/27/2015 14:21	390		
Student2	Student82	2	"Great work so far! Always good to have your product up and running. I'll answer your questions: Questions 1. Were you able to access http://ciere.azurewebsites.net? Yes 2. Were you able to upload a document, see a new row added in the table, and watch the status update from uploaded to Score Available, and the score [lastname]e from N/A to 3 � exemplary? No -- I didn't get a session link via email. 3. What do you think of the removal of the rubric in favor of a simplified score that students can use as an indicator of their work? I think it makes sense for the project. Specifically since it enables easier techniques for scoring. 4. Do you think the new scope is realistic? Yes, absolutely! Good work on rescoping. 5. If you have not taken KBAI, would you find this tool useful? I don't think I would, but if it were more general I could see it being useful (e.g. ""How good is my essay for [any class], or [any technical class]?""). a. If you have taken KBAI, do you think it would have helped you any? N/A b. If you were a TA of KBAI, and the Ciere generated score was displayed along with student peer feedback, would it have helped you grade assignments? N/A Looking forward to your final project!

Student73	Student100	2	"Nice work, seems like you have made awesome progress. I'm also making an API driven application so curious to see how your project progresses."	10/27/2015 14:33	62		
Student73	Student35	1	Looking forward to seeing this. I think you metrics make a lot of sense.	10/27/2015 14:34	202		
Student73	Student25	0	Would have liked to see more detail. As is I can't really evaluate progress. I would think pictures would make for a more interesting report as far as feedback.	10/27/2015 14:38	102		
Student73	Student28	2	"Nice progress. Per your questions: 1. I've used https://loader.io/ for load testing before - there are some other services as well. I think if you are using an API driven site you shouldn't have a problem with load for the type of traffic you'll get from OMSCS. Not sure on the other stuff, have you looked into the Unofficial Course Spreadsheet? That has a lot of good course data."	10/27/2015 14:40	175	6	
Student3	Misc3	1	"Since I am not familiar with your project, a summary of your objective would be helpful to understand the background on the information you have provided. This would allow me to provide you some better feedback. However, even though I do not know the context, the models / graphs you provided are well done and concise. I am unfamiliar with the WFI process. It is referenced so much it seems as if you are buil[lastname]g something of hydraulics and not necessarily software!"	10/27/2015 14:39	263		
Student3	Student71	1	"I like the basic approach to your UI. With navigation functionality implemented, maybe look into making ad[lastname]g some more color to it. Possibly replace the standard white background with different / rotating / random colors or even images? Also the term ""scripts"" was not clear for me in this context. I ini[firstname]lly thought of the technical programming term but that doesn't look to be the case. Is a Script something that the Instructor performs as part of the lesson / exercise; as in a Script in a Play? Make sure to define this clearly for the User or [lastname]e it to a more common term."	10/27/2015 14:58	1085		
Student3	Student60	1	"For context, I think of this tool you are developing as a replacement to the Google Doc that was created to share projects (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NHAQvVX8QyM21vddt5vearKV9k2mObhopw3TNHZn3so/edit#gid=0). I am assuming you have seen this (Piazza Post @18) and may be using it as a model. The status of your project is clear. Your model could be re-worked a bit to look a little less ""snakey"" and more structured. Regar[lastname]g your Open Question, if implementing Single Sign-On will take more than a few hours work, I wouldn't worry about it. Although most students likely use Hangouts as their primary webchat platform, you may not want to exclude Skype and other products. Once groups are formed, the students are mature enough to figure out which platform to use. Besides, OMSCS students currently have to log-in to numerous systems at this moment (BuzzPort, T-Square, Piazza, Peer Feedback - to name a few). Why not another!"	10/27/2015 15:17	836		
Student3	Student4	2	"This is an exceptional idea with incredible poten[firstname]l. I am surprised you are attempting this individually. I particularly agree with Problem #1. I graduated with my undergrad in CS with no idea / direction / and most importantly confidence of what I wanted to accomplish. To me, formal education in tech is more of a representation of ""I can learn"" difficult concepts instead of ""I know"" difficult concepts. Retaining coursework knowledge semester by semester is not likely. This is a flaw. Slew of possible helpful questions for you to consider: -Your UI is similar to my experience with CodeAcademy. Will it function similarly? -Are you developing this platform as the content creator as well? Or, can Professors upload their own material? The later seems much more feasible. -How will you test this product? Have you spoken with any professors that would be willing to test it for you?"	10/27/2015 15:31	1997		
Student80	Student67	1	"Github repo is a good idea. I've been using git, but I haven't pushed it. That may have benefits beyond the class. Will the app be live at any point? If I wanted to run it, could I? I think one of the purposes of the progress report PDF is to get feedback from other students. I don't see any requests in the document, which might mean you don't need anything at this point, but if you do want some in the future, feel free to directly address the readers!"	10/27/2015 16:13	446	5	
Student80	Student40	1	"I did take a look at the youtube playlist, but I'm not sure how to interpret the results there. What's the goal? what do you need feedback on? How do the videos relate to the 6460 project? Is the project to build a faculty website, or to show students how to build faculty websites? It seems like a large volume of video. Will this be included in the class deliverable? How will you keep it organized and navigable? When will the faculty site be live, and do you need testing?"	10/27/2015 16:30	465		
Student80	Student20	1	"How does the progress relate to the final product? The wireframes are temporary, but what about the virtual machines? Will the final product run virtualized, or is that another tool for development, like wireframes? How will students interact with the final product? Can we, as reviewers, help you by interacting with the intermediate product and provi[lastname]g feedback? Do you feel like this progress report is unnecessary overhead? Your progress seems satisfactory. However, I think you could make these reports more useful for you by addressing the reviewers directly. The zip file of ""actual"" progress was turned in to the mentor, so I think you are somewhat free to address peer reviewers here. What do you not know that you would like to know? Could we address that?"	10/28/2015 16:43	596		
Student80	Student42	1	"I took a look at the repo. It looks like a hello world MVC at this point. Did I miss anything? You will probably want a road map in the future, if you want reviewers to help by looking at code. The bitly link took me to a ""try again"" image, and I thought I'd gone to the wrong page, heh. Will the students be accessing the app directly, or will it be managed by a teacher? The interface looks like a login screen, but you might not want students to see each other's logins? More importantly, you might not want them to see each other's scores. It may be that I'm just not understan[lastname]g the hierarchy of the app based on the mockups (ie, maybe that's the instructor screen.) Any progress on the Spanish side? Will you use an m17n library or will you substitute languages based on different arrays or a similar multiplexer? Or will the datasets be separate."	10/28/2015 16:53	808

Student72	Student87	1	"Wow, what an ambitious project. I can tell you are really excited about creating a product that can really help students.

Student35	Student28	1	"Hello, Team iReady, The report does a good of summarizing your progress. I especially like the way you have listed the backend REST API in the appendix. It seems that you have put a lot of effort into thinking things through when designing your interface. Regar[lastname]g the feedback you are requesting from class (Section ""Questions/Challenges"" on Page 3), I would recommend a Jython based open source load testing tool called The Grinder. The following is the link the project: http://grinder.sourceforge.net/g3/scripts.html I have seen many large-scale open source projects using it. I also used it for my final project for my CS 6310 class. Please feel free to contact me on Piazza if you have any questions about the tool. Good luck!"	10/27/2015 21:28	547	7	
Student35	Student81	1	"While the paper nicely exhibits the author's passion about this wonderful technology, the report does not seem to adequately show what progress has been made so far in the research (if this report is an actual draft of the final deliverable, perhaps it would've been helpful to include the older/original draft in an Appendix section). As a minor aside, keeping to a single font might improve the readability of the paper. I look forward to rea[lastname]g the final paper. Good luck!"	10/27/2015 21:38	740	7	Thanks
Student35	Student100	1	"The report does a nice job of outlining the progress made and upcoming work. I especially like how you have summarized the division of labor towards the end (in the ""Future Tasks"" section). I also like Section 1, listing details about the ""Environment"" setup. (I wish I had included a similar section in my report!) From rea[lastname]g the report, it is also evident that you two have made good progress so far. Best of luck with the work ahead!"	10/27/2015 21:51	339		
Student5	Student22	2	"I really love your research by conducting curriculums comparing what is working and how adults and younger learners absorb the information. It is definitely good to ask about how to explain concepts because everyone thinks differently. Sometimes cool metaphors likes explaining ""throw catch exceptions"" with throwing catching baseball do not work (just confused me more when I was learning). Anyways, Good overall progress on your task list. Good luck!"	10/27/2015 22:14	661		
Student5	Student48	1	Sounds like you are hitting your goals. I hope your survey can give you more insights in distributed learning. Maybe you will have interesting finds. Can't wait to see you report.	10/27/2015 22:25	123

Student5	Student39	2	I really like your design. I've seen material designs a lot but haven't seen it being used in a web application other than google. You have a very detailed project progress report and seems like you are hitting all your goals.

Student47	Student30	1	"Good choice going with MediaWiki. I would have liked to hear more about your ""Vision for presentation and organization"". I didn't get a sense of whether you were on schedule or not. If you are on schedule, wonderful! If you are off schedule, you mention in your peer review your scope of your project is not fully defined and could [lastname]e, so I would just suggest work at that and make sure you define your scope and stay in scope."	10/27/2015 22:46	407

How are you going to be storing the data, what mechanism do you plan on using for detecting plagiarism? Did you develop your own PDF parser or are you using a library? Do you believe you are still on track to complete the project? As you can tell, I'm very interested in your project :P Look forward to seeing your trailer."	10/27/2015 22:53	402		
Student47	Student88	1	"I didn't realize edx was an open platform - cool! It looks like you have made A LOT of progress. To answer your peer review questions: Having an entire course in one image is fine. I actually much prefer it over dropdowns, because you can see the entire picture at once. But there are some [lastname]es I would like to see. I would like to be able to expand/collapse sections (not levels, but specific nodes in the tree). This is just in case some sections are much larger than others. I'd also like to be able to zoom-pan the visualization (assuming the tree is large and wouldn't fit the screen size). And as you already pointed out, some more color! I would like to see video length for videos (as you mentioned), same iconography that is being used on edx, use the Data Analytics API to show the view count for each section. Cant think of anything else, I think you are on the right track!"	10/27/2015 23:00	1336		
Student53	Student78	1	"Hi [firstname], looks like you've made good progress and have what you want to accomplish well sorted out. Here's are a few things: - Maybe you should use a less formal word than affect, something ""mood"", ""how do you feel"", ""what's your reaction"" to make it more casual. - As for other reactions, maybe if the student reacts like ""it is too easy"" about the question, the question is [lastname]ed to a more difficult one? - For reward system, no specific ideas on [lastname]es there. Only the word again, maybe ""achievements"" instead of ""rewards"". - And for the score, have you though about taking time to complete into consideration?"	10/27/2015 21:50	4126		
Student53	Student9	1	"Hi [firstname], I think I got one of your ini[firstname]l assignments, so it is nice to see how it has progressed. Here goes my feedback: Dawn of Flight - The idea of learning how to fly a plane, the physics about that, I like that part. But the whole project, commercialization and so on, not that much under this context (of course this is just a personal opinion). You mention Kerbal Space Program which I didn't know it existed, but after taking a look at it I compare it with your idea and would feel more motivated to try out with space rather than with airplanes, the main reason being is that space is something not yet figured out, and there are companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic trying to achieve that, therefor it is more enticing to do a simulation that emulates that. From the airplane part maybe I would just look for a simulator software. The Sea - This one sounds more fun to me, and more complete. I think everything you mention is very applicable still to real life events and very complete sociologically speaking as it will teach commerce, crime, environment. If I had to choose between dawn of flight or the sea I would go for the sea. Hope this helps!"	10/27/2015 22:59	1356

Student18	Student51	2	"Hi Team You have made an excellent prototype. Now that I can see it in action I can better understand what your team is trying to create. I have one idea that I think could be useful. Not everyone is good with camera and creativity. Also teachers and parents would love to share their work with others when they find their videos are helping their children. You can tap on this and let users of your app to get connected and share their work. May be you can create an online library and allow users to share their videos, search and use others ideas."	10/28/2015 15:51	93		
Student18	Student75	1	Hi [firstname] You have provided very well detailed UML diagrams. But I don�t have any reference to your project idea or proposal so I cannot correlate all your work. But I do believe that you have made a good progress over the past weeks and are on track as you are closely following the milestones. Good luck to your project and I look forward to the final outcome.	10/28/2015 16:06	874		
Student18	Student17	1	"Hi Aperta Team It is really good to know that you are working on a communication tool specifically for OMSCS students. However, I do feel that your team is a little behind the schedule considering the scope of your project. I might be wrong in this as I don�t know about your timeline but I suppose your project should have passed the design phase and entered the prototype/co[lastname]g phase. As for the feedback on design, I like piazza look where all post titles are displayed in a pane on the left-side of the same page. Displaying them on a separate page will increase the number of clicks for same action and might lead to less user friendly approach. Other feature you could introduce can be up-voting/down-voting for individual posts. In this way students could vote the posts that they find helpful and want others to read them too. A nice and helpful way for students to highlight important posts."	10/28/2015 16:21	4965		
Student16	Student59	2	"Hi [firstname], Love that you have explicit questions for the reviewers. Unfortunately I have little experience with NLP. For training purposes, is there any chance you can write to a K-12 textbook publisher, maybe get desk copies assigned online? Though it's a very narrow set of topics, I have to think the materials are explicitly geared towards an age group and would make up a large amount of material. Sounds like you're making great progress on your app!"	10/28/2015 7:59	184

Student41	Student101	1	"I believe that you've designed a very good questionnaire and one that is open-ended enough to capture trends and specifics that will help your research. I know that I've reviewed your materials before, but I can't remember what, exactly, is the nature of your research. That said, I was wondering if you might want to include more demographic information in your survey. For instance, you have a question related to how long an instructor has been teaching, but would it help to know their age? Might you find that older instructors are less comfortable with using tech in the classroom? Perhaps that's not one of the variables that you're interested in. I was also wondering if it might be beneficial to ask how their schools supported any kinds of technology rollouts. Perhaps a poorly-implemented tech rollout is met with disdain by instructors because they haven't been ""set up for success."" You do have a question related to receiving support for tech issues, but I wonder if that addresses how well they were prepared to use them in the first place. Best of luck moving forward. It's looking good!"	10/28/2015 11:59	2344	7	"Great tips, THANKS!"
Student41	Student61	1	"I'm undertaking a design project, too, and I know from experience that it's tough to demonstrate much this early in the development life cycle. From what I see in this document, things appear to be progressing well. From what I'm gathering about your project, you're helping learners determine what programming languages to attempt based on what they've already learned and I think that's a great idea. Good luck with your project as it continues."	10/28/2015 13:20	1585	5	Wish I got some feedback on my UML. The encouragement feedback is great but doesn't help with actual implementation.
Student41	Student6	1	"I've done a fair amount of software training throughout the years, and determining the proper tool for creating the simulation is always a tough call. I've resorted in the past to recreating interfaces and logic in a tool that I'm more familiar with and training on more discreet ideas (where I know that I only need to implement a subset of the system's functionality). I've used screen caps of the real system and overlaid controls that I wanted to include in the simulation. It's tough for a project this brief that Matlab is making this so difficult. Hopefully you'll be able to harness the power of SIMAC in time, but maybe think about what I said as a contingency? It poten[firstname]lly steers learners more than having the simulations be self-guided, but I believe it's still a very effective application-based approach. Good luck over the next few weeks!"	10/28/2015 13:47	706		
Student41	Student26	1	"I don't believe that I've reviewed any of your project proposals before now, so it's a little tough to surmise what's going on.

It almost looks like you're buil[lastname]g a mini-LMS, but I'm guessing that you're not going to be deploying any online courses from your application. I applaud you for inclu[lastname]g a responsive design as part of the project. I look forward to seeing future iterations of this project.

Student101	Student45	2	"I love your project and hope it goes through with no major issues.

Student101	Student64	1	You have a great project and a very noble one at that. The prediction for 2020 is very interesting; I had no clue that especially in the computer field that there may be a shortage.

Student26	Student64	2	"Hello Team Code Element, Your research topic is very interesting and looks like you are well on your way. Your progress report was clear and explained well what you planned to do, what you have completed so far, and what your follow-up schedule is for the future. Even though I do not remember reviewing your work before, it was easy for me to follow. Your list of interviews is impressive! Based on the list it seems like you have contacts in 3 different states, which is good because it will give you more perspective across states. I also enjoyed rea[lastname]g your comments on the interviews conducted so far. It seemed like a sneak peek and made me want to find out more. It is quite baffling earth science trumps CS, or perhaps they just can't find the teachers to teach it so they can't offer it? One of the comments I have heard on this, it is hard to attract CS majors to teach when you can earn triple in the industry. I don't have any actionable feedback for your team at this time. Just keep doing what you are doing, you are on the right path for sure."	10/28/2015 20:41	2031		
Student26	Student101	1	"Hello [firstname], It sounds like you are well on your way and have a clear idea of where you are headed. Your questionnaire looks interesting. I was curious about who you are planning to interview and how you were going to analyze the results with the open-ended format. Overall I think you provided a good description of what you have completed so far and where you are headed. Though, since I do not recall rea[lastname]g any of your earlier assignments, it is unclear to me what project you are working on and what problem you are addressing. You should include a couple of sentences describing your project idea or your elevator pitch, just to get all readers on the same page. It would make it easier to follow your writing and to provide relevant feedback."	10/28/2015 21:15	1122	7	"Thanks for the feedback. I wanted to go with open ended questions so that the answers are 100% original thus provi[lastname]g a better internal validity. You are correct I should have included a link to my proposal so the reader has a better understan[lastname]g of my idea, or like you said I should have gave some insight on my idea."
Student26	Student45	2	"Hello team IReady, It was nice seeing your progress report. I had already looked at it briefly on piazza. I wish your tool was already around for use..! While rea[lastname]g your report, I especially enjoy all your UI work and visualizations of what you are doing or going to do. It is so easy to get the idea from just a few images. Maybe you want to keep taking images along the project timeline and eventually you can show the full evolution from wireframes to a live site. Anyway; is your testing website public and accessible somewhere? I would have wanted to play with it. Post it on piazza if you have one. For the backend, if you have to do a lot of API calls but the data is relatively fixed (e.g. semester grades), you may want to consider some type of organization that asynchronously collects and puts it in a database that you can then query, of even directly store it on the webserver. It will reduce dependencies in case one of the external api servers goes down. It may be what you are doing already, I just was not sure. As far as graphing, my favorite at this time is http://www.highcharts.com/ but it is proprietary. Instead I have used google charts; I have heard of these, but not used the following: http://d3js.org/, http://morrisjs.github.io/morris.js/, http://www.chartjs.org/ to comment on your questions/challenges, 1) I'm not sure it you are talking about testing on the client or server side, would need to know what your backend technologies are. For front end testing, check out karma: http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html 2) is there no api for google+, twitter, facebook? set up list of keywords and run search against each media channel using those terms. Write script to dump the results into a database 3) I would say frequency of use would be one measure at least. For example I really like google+, I check it out daily (the fact that it pops up on google.com is a plus). Many other omscs sites I don't visit, or visit them very rarely. Those are not as successful in my opinion."	10/28/2015 21:35	1887

Now the project is clearly defined and scoped and well on its way. I am quite curious about this hypothesis and the different sources of data, and eventually seeing the correlation and fin[lastname]gs you will have. I am also wondering if this research can be scaled to other courses to develop success metrics for different OMSCS cources? It would be interesting to see if and how much the metrics differ between different courses. If this was applicable to all of OMSCS, maybe it can be used by team IReady in their OMSCS preparation app?

I don't think that your graphics need to be flashy it looks good to me as far as a child's perspective. I had a few 8 year olds nearby (4 of them) and they thought it looked cool.

Student70	Student44	1	"Hi [firstname], I think your Progress Report was not uploaded entirely but based on what it is shown int the slide it seems to be a very interesting project. I think it is a very valid research trying to understand the causes for dropping from school and identifying possible apps that can close that gap. Is this for undergrad level? are you considering creating the first app hitting the top cause?"	10/28/2015 23:53	380		
Student70	Student86	1	"Hi team EMOT, unfortunately I think your progress report was not uploaded entirely so it is very hard for me to provide a good feedback. I guess you are on the right track having weekly meetings and having all your tasks well identify until the end of the semester. A question for you is how are you going to correlate your data? It seems a lot of information you will get, so it is important for you to analyze it and correlated to fully understand it."	10/28/2015 23:59	574		
Student70	Student5	2	"Hi Team, Your report looks excellent, it is clear you have been doing very good job so far. Unfortunately I couldn't get what your project is doing, are you redefining the OMSCS page? or it is just a tool to help you get up to speed to use all existing tools? Based on my experience JUnit is a very powerful tool if your backend is java, which I guess it is. Also Postman is probably the best tool to test RestAPI calls, but also you can create small programs using Java or some other languages (I have used python too) to create these RestAPI calls, and you can automate the execution on every build. Keep the good work!"	10/29/2015 0:19	406		
Student70	Student48	1	"Hi, I think your project is interesting and challenging but unfortunately I don't think it was uploaded entirely, but based on this report is seems you have been doing good progress but there is still a lot to be done. I think Distributing Learning is a fascinating concept that is growing rapidly, keep doing a good job!"	10/29/2015 0:25	463		
Student48	Student84	0	Very good breakdown of tasks and progress completed. It would be helpful if you listed any complications you ran into or you see now that you are developing the application.	10/29/2015 0:01	97		
Student48	Student22	2	"Very good breakdown of tasks and work completed per team member. The individual quotes is a nice touch. Along with the questions posed to reviewers and teams. I'm not sure i fully understand your first Question to TA and Reviewers. For you second question. I think you're pretty spot on with the amount of information, inclu[lastname]g the breakdown of work per team member will really help keep track of the work that is remaining. To be more effective I would suggest making sure you don't increase the scope of your project as time goes on. There might be a temptation incorporate a new idea, but you'll need to [firstname]gh how much time it adds versus value."	10/29/2015 0:03	264		
Student48	Student39	1	"The screenshots/wireframes for your project is a great addition which shows a clear progress. The architectural diagram is interesting, but I would suggest focus more on the concepts and less on the technology. It is very interesting to see the stack, but the technology icons are cluttering up the design."	10/29/2015 0:07	144		
Student48	Student44	1	Having the color coded task list is very helpful. It would be interesting to know more information about the status of the tasks completed. What have you learned so far in your research? Have there been any notable fin[lastname]gs so far? Or finds which might counter your hypotheses?	10/29/2015 0:10	288		
Student65	Student50	1	"There is some very interesting data here. I was wondering how you will end your project though, since it seems to me that you will need to follow individuals to see who sticks it out and who gets out."	10/29/2015 0:37	365		
Student65	Student66	1	"this sounds great. My only question is how is this different from other applications out there? I see you are focusing more on mature programming, but what sets this apart? It sounds like you have a solid plan to get this working and I look forward to see your result."	10/29/2015 0:44	299		
Student65	Student96	1	Sounds interesting. Do you have any implementation details to share yet?	10/29/2015 0:49	466	6	
Student65	Student55	1	"I am really looking forward to seeing and using your app. I am in my 3rd term in the program and I'm taking sort of a flow and I go method, and I'd like to have more of a plan, but I am overwhelmed by the decisions and planning process. For example, my time ticket is on friday and I am not sure what I am going to register for yet. You have a good base of features already listed, so it looks like you are on your way. The only question I have is what form your application will take?"	10/29/2015 0:56	360		
Student55	Student50	2	"I *love* seeing the survey results in your progress report. When I took it I thought to myself, ""I would kill to know what the overall response was,"" but wasn't sure I would until the end of the course. 100+ subjects is actually quite impressive! You must have been very focused in your approach to roun[lastname]g up subjects. I wish I could suggest additional forums for reaching folks - however, the only (slight) possibility I've come up with is that you might be able to talk Nate [lastname] into pinning your post about the survey (on the OMSCS Google+ group) for a few days. I'm a little fuzzy on where you go from here - is your goal just to summarize these results, now, or are you planning additional surveys focusing in on a particular area? Either way - neat stuff, and I look forward to the finished product."	10/29/2015 3:09	337		
Student55	Student34	1	"Okay, I have 6 seconds remaining to finish this review... Excellent synopsis of your effort to date. From just this progress report I'm not quite clear on what dimensions you're gathering to assess the impact of peer review - is it primarily student performance (i.e., grades) or do you also have a way of looking at student feedback (i.e., ratings of their course experience)? Is the remainder of your work on the project additional data collection, or is there a significant analysis component to be performed as well? I continue to think this is one of the neater projects in the course - getting (and giving) peer reviews has been very helpful to me in previous courses, and I think a (semi-)controlled study of its impact has a great chance of encouraging more courses to adopt it. If you haven't already, I hope you're soon able to begin thinking about how you might follow up on and publicize your results within the program."	10/29/2015 3:15	556		
Student55	Student46	2	"Impressive progress - from zero to a working game in just a few weeks! I'm not clear on how one would play this game on an iOS device, since it's written in Java and iOS doesn't allow installing a Java plugin for its browsers. Are you thinking Oracle ADF Mobile? This is not going to be easy, since you'll have to rewrite the UI in HTML5 (probably using a canvas & Javascript animation). You may also be underestimating the difficulty of putting it on Android (the flavor of Java used for Android native apps is not *technically* real Java -- it was forked around Java 1.6 and lacks many of the modern language's features... long story). You mention fin[lastname]g hosting; if you're just hosting static HTML5/CSS/JS, Amazon's free tier should be more than enough - or Google Cloud Storage's free tier. Ping me (Student55) if you're curious for more details about how you might do this. Actually, if your mentor is OK with this, I could step you through the whole setup process for a static site on S3 - it should take 2-3 hours at most. Sorry for zeroing in on the mobile / web bits - that's my specialty so I always nerd out about it when given the chance. As far as the questions you asked: 1) Probably [but I might not keep playing it too long - depends on how fun it is]. 2) Probably not - at least, not if I didn't know it was developed by a fellow OMSCS student. 3-6) I'm not a big fan of tutorials and popups in general. I'm not sure whether or not the game meets its educational goals (I don't think I could tell without playing it), but if it doesn't, I don't think a tutorial will help. While I can't tell you whether the game meets its goals, I can offer some thoughts on how you might decide. In my mind, games are very good at training skills, and very bad at conveying knowledge. They're good at training skills because of a tendency of games to be repetitive with scaling difficulty (i.e., you do basically the same thing, only it gradually becomes more challenging). Game development as a discipline is very attuned to the idea of the learning curve, and I think most game developers these days are quite practiced with the techniques required to design an effective learning curve. Conversely, they're bad at conveying knowledge because of this same repetitiveness. Efficiently (and effectively) acquiring knowledge requires forming connections between that knowledge and one's existing knowledge base, which in turn means interacting with a new piece of knowledge in a number of different ways and a number of different contexts. This means that (1) the ""surface area"" of one's existing knowledge has a big impact on how well and how quickly one can learn, and (2) one frequently must be told something in a number of different ways before it ""hits home"" and one remembers it. Computers are not good at provi[lastname]g endless creative variations of presentation. They can recombine elements in a limited number of ways but even this comes at a high programming cost. Thankfully, there are many skills that are important parts of education (and in particular software education), and some of those skills relate to binary, so if your game is targeting these it could be quite successful. If you buy into my idea that games are ideal for skill-buil[lastname]g, the measure of an educational game is whether its gameplay *intrinsically* requires you to master the targeted skill - that is, is the skill directly on the path to success in the game? I don't know how to answer this one because I don't know your precise goal with the game - binary is an important thing to understand, but what *skills* are you hoping they'll acquire? 7-8) I do understand binary - actually, when I was in the age group you're probably targeting with this game, I was designing my own language which used (among other things) a base-16 counting system. So I'm probably not the target demographic. :-) Sorry for the length of this feedback - I hope it has helped a bit, and given you some food for thought. Keep up your hard work, and happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/29/2015 3:26	2199		
Student55	Student91	0	"I struggled quite a bit to understand what the big picture was for this project. (If the original proposal could have been included with it as an appendix, I think that would have helped. As it was, I don't understand the ultimate goal, so that made it doubly hard to understand where things stand and what remains to be done.) I also don't understand the functionality of the extension at all. Where is the popup window and why do we want to be able to send messages back and forth between that and the control panel? This is all on one computer, correct? The big thing that I would have liked to see in this report is an explanation of how this takes you towards the final goal, and what work still remains to get there. I think that would have helped me understand the details of the current extension as well. It's pretty neat that you've built a Chrome extension - I had no idea that you had to do the UI using QT, or that the extension had to be written in C++! With all of that, it's not surprising that getting the framework built required so much investment. Hopefully you'll have more fun in the weeks ahead, as you get to fill in the core functionality for your project. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	10/29/2015 4:03	1229	7	
Student54	Student79	1	Don't give up on JavaScript. It is an amazing and useful language. I found that incorporating the [lastname]trap framework for front end work took me from developer to developer/designer overnight. I suggest you take a look at it if you aren't familiar with it http://get[lastname]trap.com/. I'm very curious where this will end up. I'm looking forward to seeing your results.	10/29/2015 11:43	149		
Student54	Student88	1	"Well, I'd probably not be the ideal person to evaluate the need for this. I prefer to read through a syllabus and get the answers I need regar[lastname]g the scope of work involved in a particular class (even ones provided by edx, MOOCs, etc). I tend to learn what I need to on the fly and rely on the instructors/course-material to lead me through the needs of the course. Very interesting way to go about this. Also, using the open source edX intrigues me. Good luck!"	10/29/2015 11:45	320		
Student54	Student32	1	"Wow, fantastic project. I really like your setup. I'm curious about your use of Google App Engine. I've personally never used that service. I didn't see any questions related to feedback concerning the project, but I it really looks good so far. Great start! Keep up the good work."	10/29/2015 11:51	142		
Student54	Student33	1	Interesting project. I'm all for introducing programming to as many students as possible. I think you'll find many valuable insights as a result of your interviews. I hope that you release your data along with your final project. Looks great! Keep up the good work.	10/29/2015 11:53	133		
Student21	Student96	1	Looks like you have a lot of work done. Since I do not have the ini[firstname]l proposal I am not able to say how much progress has been made towards the end goal.	10/29/2015 12:01	238		
Student21	Student66	1	"I am able see the work done till now, but I am not able to compare it with the project proposal to see the progress made as I don't have your project proposal."	10/29/2015 12:05	190		
Student21	Student65	2	"Looks like you have made very good progress, Do you have plans to create a test suite for the apis and do some load testing? I have a daughter who will be in high school next year. Are you planning to make your tool available to the public? :-)"	10/29/2015 12:09	468		
Student21	Student38	1	"In spite of travel interruptions, looks like you have made good progress. I have done porting before but not automatically converting code from python to java. I searched the web and came across this website https://www.varycode.com/. I have never used it but I thought I will share it here. All the best!"	10/29/2015 12:17	883	7	Provided a tip that I will check out!
Student98	Student83	1	"Great paper. Some other diagnostic tasks that might be beneficial for the target audience might include how to use a computer or another form of technology. Since your target audience are generation z's, it might be useful to do a little research on your target audience too. Here are a couple of links to get started http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/move-millennials-gen-z/296577/ and http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-generation-z-born-in-the-digital-age-2015-2 . For visual cues...I remember the paper clip in Microsoft Word was a help aid that was not in human form. Your aid could display their name to make it feel inclusive. Pokeman or another character could also be used."	10/29/2015 10:41	16449		
Student98	Student13	1	Good paper. I did not see any questions for the reviewer to answer or respond to in the paper. I am curious on how the gradebook information was access since I am in the course currently. Seems like they would not release the information for research without permission from the students. Interesting work	10/29/2015 15:15	340		
Student98	Student8	1	Great paper. I like how you provided questions pertaining to your project at the end. I do not know a lot about Autism or the social skills that they lack so I cannot suggest did kinds of games but it looks like you are on a good start. I would at least have 3 different scena[lastname] to pick from.	10/29/2015 15:21	332		
Student98	Student99	1	Great progress report. I liked that you included stats and your timeline so readers could see if you are on time with your schedule. Good luck on the finish product.	10/29/2015 15:27	362		
Student42	Student38	1	"Straightforward project plan and good explanation of the issues you're facing. I certainly think windows support for the tool is a good idea, and if you have to make any significant additions/modifications to the python code it also seems like a worthwhile endeavor to port it to Java. Wish I had more expertise to share with you on that effort, but good luck to you."	10/29/2015 20:32	622	6	Appreciate the comments.
Student42	Student20	1	"Sounds as if you have your ini[firstname]l infrastructure well in-place and are ready to start development in earnest. A similar position to our group, and I think a good spot overall given the overall schedule of the course."	10/29/2015 20:42	2451		
Student42	Student67	1	"Similar to our group, it sounds as if you have made good progress with your interface design and begun implementation which should leave you ample opportunity to complete your development on time."	10/29/2015 21:23	506	5	
Student42	Student21	1	"Soundsa as if you are making great progress, look forward to seeing the results."	10/29/2015 21:32	783		
Student17	Student75	1	The level of detail in these diagrams was astoun[lastname]g. I would have liked to see more user interface mocks or background information regar[lastname]g your project though (I am unfamiliar with it).	10/29/2015 22:55	542		
Student17	Student3	1	"I think that your concept is a great start for such a program. However, much of it may rely on feedback from live implementation. Interested to see how it turns out! I think that you should certainly include network diagrams, or at least easily interpreted diagrams. In terms of length or word count, I would encourage you to attempt getting your point across in as little words as possible, while still maintaining understan[lastname]g."	10/29/2015 23:04	135	6	
Student17	Student71	2	"The depth and scope of your project is extremely impressive. The fact that all your team members are ramping up on iOS/Swift development in such a short period of time is an extreme challenge. Additionally, I find your topic and application admirable. As a mobile developer, I can tell that your team is definitely on the right track. The screens in this report definitely show how far you've come. Keep up the great work."	10/29/2015 23:06	224	7	Nice to get some feedback on difficulties of ramp up. Was feeling a little bad about it taking more time than normal.
Student17	Student60	1	"Was really hoping that someone from our class would make something like this. As someone who's been in classes, in OMSCS specifically, that don't have group set-up structures, it is wildly infuriating and unorganized. Would have liked to see any mocks or UI designs for the proposed product. As for authentication, yes I would encourage you to use Google's authentication platform. I'm actually working on an OMSCS communication tool and opted for Google at first, but eventually went with Slack (because of their superior communication structure). Looking forward to how your project turns out."	10/29/2015 23:11	206		
Student97	Student61	1	"Sounds great, your are progressing well. I tested your appspot, add a book and saw a very cute cat :D So I am sure your server is ready and you have everything you need to implement it. Look forward to your great project. Keep up the good work!"	10/30/2015 11:14	1000	5	I like cats too.
Student97	Student7	0	Great progress. I visited prettyswift.co and impressed with your ini[firstname]l work. I definitely book[firstname]ed your web and look forward for more progress.	10/30/2015 11:31	737		
Student97	Student10	1	Wow I am impressed with your progress. Do you have a domain name where i can test your project? I think it would be great if it is available on Internet. Look forward for more progress. Keep up the good work!	10/30/2015 11:43	191		
Student97	Student41	1	"Sounds that you are progressing very well. The problem with SMS messages is that we can't group messages into thread. It is similar with other messaging like email. The way email group into a thread is using a Subject line, similar subject with ""Re:"" grouped into one thread. In sms there is a limited number of characters, so you have to put some ""subject"" or ""title"" anywhere in the SMS. You can make a mobile application to help SME texting without bother writing the title, it will be inserted automatically by your apps."	10/30/2015 11:47	1256		
Student49	Student59	1	"Seems like you are on track, and sorry to hear about your impediment with quality data retrieval. I've done things like that in the past where I want to remove tedious tasks such as data gathering, mostly leveraging php as a web crawler and formatting each set of data as I wish or selenium/qtp could be programmed to crawl and scrape as well. Not sure what you were using, but if the data is not structured in a repetitive form it does become a little harder. Best of luck going forward, seems like a really beneficial idea to tackle."	10/30/2015 13:14	727		
Student49	Student29	2	"Seems like you folks are on the right path and passing milestones in time. As an AT&T employee, I have been through two of JT's and hope he can share with your group and the younger students the success he has had within the company. Seems the app we are developing may complement what you folks are doing, ours is more targeting towards adult learners, keeping them engaged on learning new emerging technologies and acting as a centralized hub for application to project specific areas. Basically learning and applying to various real-life situations with help from coworkers. We are leveraging responsive web design and in browser virtual machines so everything can be done on any device. Not sure if you can leverage anything that we are doing, but hope it helps."	10/30/2015 13:26	435		
Student49	Student24	1	"I'm a little confused on the idea but I understand the architectural design, just one question, nowadays with varying devices will you be applying responsive web design to accommodate varying screen sizes, ie mobile, tablet, desktop? It is always good to think about this from the start then to try to incorporate later. My team also is using a client/server mvc architecture but within a single page application leveraging rwd for varying device sizes. Just a thing to think about, glad to hear you are ahead of schedule"	10/30/2015 13:34	295	6	"Thanks [firstname]. Right now the setup will work as a Desktop application, but given time I can add other style sheets to accommodate for other devices."
Student49	Student18	1	"Cute, but I feel other systems out there could be leveraged to add this instead of the number scale. Is the bonus of this the visual aspect? Because with the system's my courses use now they have scales, they could incorporate emoticons to those, strongly agree/strongly disagree and scale between. I do agree that a common survey framework should be used. Glad to hear you are on track."	10/30/2015 13:39	406

Student78	Student49	0	"A great saying is ""if I had only an hour to save the world, I would spend 50 minutes planning and 10 minutes saving the world"". Sounds like you have gotten your planning done and are ready to work just be careful that there is a point of too much planning where it doesn't leave you time to implement. Good luck on your project."	10/30/2015 17:35	158		
Student78	Student29	1	Looks like you have both accomplished a lot and still have a lot of work ahead of you. Good progress report and good luck on your project.	10/30/2015 17:38	110

Student20	Student65	1	"Seems like your team is very much on track to complete your project on time. Very impressive documentation of your REST API. I was also not aware of the Stormpath services. My only worries would be reliance on a third party set of services that could leave your project at the mercy of their future [lastname]es and upgrades. Overall, it looks like a very solid and well thought out service to add to your stack. The project as a whole will be a very functional and have a straightforward and flexible architecture. I look forward to seeing how this project evolves."	10/30/2015 22:10	381

I was not aware of Jython and it's ability to combine Java and python code. There will definitely be some growing pains with converting from Python to Java, but considering you will be going from a more simple language to a more complex one, the [lastname]e should not be impossible as if you were going the other direction.

Student37	Student83	2	"I really like where you are going with this. I believe scenario based learning like this has lots of promising educaitonal rewards for your participants. A dirtbike though? Middle schoolers don't usually drive anything more advanced than a regular bike. Stuff they interact with every day: computers, smartphones, minecraft (and redstone contraptions inside this game), and they'd probaby follow a diagnostic on a simplified car, or bus pretty well."	10/30/2015 22:15	478		
Student37	Student43	2	"This is almost a meta educational project because you are teaching yourself first to build software that teaches somebody else how to optimally pour a drink. Your progress looks good- but remember the golden rule: focus on function over form. Don't worry so much about the models, just push out somethign that works first."	10/30/2015 22:23	127		
Student37	Student98	1	This reads more like a schedule much more than it is a progress report... However I think you have some good survey questions. Hopefully you can get this stuff encoded into your language of choice.	10/30/2015 22:25	234		
Student37	Student13	2	"I am blown away by this progress report. I hope that you can move forward with the full feature set analysis in time, but this is still good progress. It is vry good that you are assessing your risks ahead of time!"	10/30/2015 22:29	78
