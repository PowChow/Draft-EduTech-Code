Student1	Student50	2	Great presentation! I think this information could be very useful to both students and the administration. I'd like to see your data plugged into an online visualization tool.	11/16/2015 16:45	118		
Student1	Student77	1	Interesting concept but from the trailer I don't quite understand the use case. It is strictly to aggregate content for each course? And the content is curated by the instructor?	11/16/2015 16:50	132		
Student1	Student55	2	Thank you for provi[lastname]g a trailer with clear narration instead of a music soundtrack. Makes it much easier to understand your project. I think this is a great idea! Are you planning on allowing students to create a profile or somehow hook into GA Tech so the application will know what classes a student has taken?	11/16/2015 16:56	196		
Student1	Student93	1	"This is a great concept. Is the typing monitor process a web based tool, so it only works with web based text editors, or will there be a desktop version as well?"	11/16/2015 17:02	60	6	
Student74	Student51	1	The guy narrating the video was difficult to understand.	11/16/2015 16:52	41	7	Have to rate my own team mate as very helpful
Student74	Student95	1	"Very entertaining video! Moreover, it seems like you've been thinking about this for a long time, and it is great to see your product being developed. Regar[lastname]g what I would use for the body of robots, I am a huge comic book fan, so I would probably use some of my action figures (and pieces of old action figures my dog took too much of a liking to) to try to make some sort of [firstname]enstein-type vehicle. I am unsure as to what type of components are available, but would cameras be an option? Having just dabbled with computer vision, that is something that I would like to explore. In terms of teaching: I think it is a great opportunity on using robotics to teach something further. Maybe robots that can collect garbage, or that can go around the house and turn lights off when nobody is in a room."	11/16/2015 22:49	590		
Student74	Student83	1	Good job! It seems like you've incorporated early feedback into your project and that you are on the final stages of it. Best of luck!	11/16/2015 23:00	234		
Student74	Student87	1	"In terms of functionality-features, it seems like you have it covered, especially considering how large the possible application of your system seems to be. A feature that is not related specifically to functionality would be to convert the system maybe to a RESTful interface (I understand it is late in the game for this) as that would give me more flexibility in terms of how to implement it. Regar[lastname]g improvement: it is very difficult to make a very general tool something that excels at anything. Sometimes focusing in just a couple of very good features aimed to specific demographic pays off! Good work on the video. Best of luck!"	11/17/2015 21:00	193		
Student22	Student29	2	This is JT - I got to review my own team's Trailer! I've seen it I like it.	11/16/2015 17:40	70		
Student22	Student46	2	"Hi [firstname]! You might remember me ""JT"" - JT3892. If I recall you were in one of the Java classes I teach at AT&T. Thoughts: Nice tool, looks like you know Java very well (would like to see the code one day) - Great Job! Unique Idea I never thought of teaching binary that way.... in nybble like chuncks at a time... (nibble is half a byte - rarely used term). I taught binary to a group of high schoolers a few weeks ago... this tool would have helped - they really thought binary was cool once they got the hang of it. If you get to try your tool in front of a group of students I'd be interested in hearing how it went. I am sure you will do well in the class. JT"	11/16/2015 17:49	313	7	
Student22	Student88	2	"Hi [firstname], Your tool looks very nice and is impressive! I feel it gives a much better view of courses than I see now through Ga Tech/Udacity. I really like the collapse and expand functionality. I also like the idea of unique icons based on what the topic is instead of the title (this allows quick identification of subject matter). Seeing video length using the API from YouTube is a nice touch. Suggestions you asked for: Colors might be better if they were more contrasting a little, darker blue for example. You might show CORE material in one color, but supplementary material in another ( like for further rea[lastname]g). For video length: maybe have an option to see what the video length is for an entire section (basically ad[lastname]g up all the sub items). Other than that I think you did a very good job and will do well in the class. Good Luck!"	11/16/2015 18:05	402		
Student22	Student68	2	This is JT - I got to review my own team's Trailer! I've seen it I like it. (Received it twice out of four entries.) - this is the second review!	11/16/2015 18:13	27		
Student16	Student88	0	"The visualization is very interesting, but it's unclear to me what problem you're solving or need you're fulfilling."	11/16/2015 18:13	371		
Student16	Student25	0	"This was a an interesting presentation of virtualization technologies, but it's not clear to me what your project is or what you've done in the last few weeks."	11/16/2015 18:19	241	2	
Student16	Student22	1	"Trailer was a little painful, rea[lastname]g the PPT to me. NPS is used to gauge customer relationship quality, do you consider satisfaction to be the key outcome in CS education? Questions posed at the end were particularly interesting, would have like to hear some of your thoughts or more detail here."	11/16/2015 18:24	233		
Student16	Student46	1	"Would suggest a splash screen at the start of each level... if I was playing this, as an adult, and saw tubes for ""one, two, three"" and a ball labeled ""10"", would be completely taken aback. Though kids tend to grasp concepts and ""go with it"" much more quickly, they equally get quickly frustrated."	11/16/2015 18:27	359	6	
Student90	Student73	1	"This was a nice video trainer. It was clear and I was able to understand the app. The app is great as it is; however here are some suggestions: 1. GUI: There is too much blank space on the first window. It seems that the columns could be half the width and still could be read well. 2. It would be helpful to print the list of courses taken, the specialization courses, and the courses left to take. 3. It would be most helpful if the program read from the GATECH database, instead of relying on user input."	11/16/2015 18:29	211		
Student90	Student11	1	It was difficult to understand what the project is about. It seemed at first that it was an instant message app. They I think that you suggested that the program reads the instant messages and highlights on the video related words? The problem I see is if I'm sen[lastname]g IM's I will not be able to pay attention to the video at all. Maybe the useful thing to do is to have a search window that localizes the parts on the video that match the search parameters.	11/16/2015 18:36	192		
Student90	Student8	1	"By watching the video I could not figure out what the project was about. Thankfully, you included a link to your proposal. I still have lots of questions. The social story is about not jumping on people and on things. However, the main character frequently runs over people. On the story the commentator says that ""jumping on things can break them,"" however, the aim of the game seems to be to jump on things. The noise is also very distracting and the score is difficult to read because of the cyan background. I think that programming this game was probably a lot of fun for you. However, the game does not do merits to your paper. I think your proposal was well researched and provided well defined action items. I think there is a big gap between your paper and the game. I do not want to discourage you as the subject is worthwhile ."	11/16/2015 18:54	550		
Student90	Student19	1	"This project seems promising. I was able to understand the goal of the application and I think it will be very useful. The only thing I would [lastname]e is that I would make the sprite a little larger so it could have more detail. This is just a personal choice, though. I'm looking forward seeing your final product."	11/16/2015 19:18	124	5	
Student82	Student2	1	"Looks great! It looks similar to an app I use on WIndows Phone called Microsoft Math. I think this app would be great for an educational setting, although to work in the classroom apps would need to be created for iOS, Android and Windows Phone (for the one or two of us out there on it :P) to account for student personal preferences."	11/16/2015 20:09	194		
Student82	Student101	1	"The pace of the trailer was a little metered, but it was a good presentation. It looks like you have a good method for research and have started collecting and summarizing survey results."	11/16/2015 20:12	239	7	
Student82	Student3	2	Very detailed trailer.	11/16/2015 20:16	3917	1	
Student82	Student28	2	"I think this is the first video that fits the classic definition of a trailer and is more than a status update. Well done! My only feedback is perhaps [lastname]ing the text ""who are wishing to be prepared"" to ""who wish to be prepared""."	11/16/2015 21:24	63	6	"Thanks for the feedback and pointer, [firstname]!"
Student53	Student13	2	"HI Nate, [firstname], Nate, you are a great presenter. Even though it was way past the 3 minute [firstname] it was very interesting and compelling. A trailer in some sense like a movie trailer tries to engage someone and be interested in seeing the end product, I definitely want to see your publication once it is out there, in part because I already took KBAI so I wonder where I fit under the context of your research. As to why Graduate / PhD students perform better, here goes another hypothesis, which lies more on the subjective side. I think doing a graduate program requires more ""self motivation"" than doing a bachelors, doing a bachelors is a most, doing a masters not really. So people who have been through a graduate program already are more likely to do what it takes to finish assignments. Good luck during the coming weeks, and I look forward to your end results. [firstname]"	11/16/2015 20:11	939	7	Thanks & that is awesome [firstname]! Glad that you loved it! Thanks again for the great feedback!
Student53	Student33	2	"Hi [firstname], [firstname], Great presentation, I have recently been rea[lastname]g articles related to making co[lastname]g/cs part of curriculum for schools, I think it is the way to go, definitely a good skill to have regardless of the profession that those kids grow up to pursue. Your research looks like something that can help ""get there"". Have you seen this? https://hourofcode.com/us might help for your research. Good luck wrapping this project up during the coming weeks, I look forward to your paper. [firstname]"	11/16/2015 20:26	888		
Student53	Student48	2	"Hi [firstname], your research paper looks very promising, it is great that you have found good data sources, that will definitely help make the paper more reliable. In regards to the survey, somewhere in piazza I read of someone using this reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize you might want to give it a try in case you haven't already done so. Good luck with the last weeks of the project, am looking forward to your paper! [firstname]"	11/16/2015 20:48	298		
Student53	Student42	2	"In one word: Brilliant. It is unfortunate that there is no ""Yes, and in fact, it super exceeded my expectations"" option, I would have used that. Progress is great, app looks great, and the trailer, how did you guys get Morgan Freeman to narrate this presentation? Great work."	11/16/2015 20:53	174		
Student10	Student22	1	"I think that you've done a good job with the presentation, and explained your project well. I think that the overall approach is good too - try something, get feedback, iterate on that feedback, and so on. One unanswered question is what are ""younger learners?"" though - high school students? However, this all seems very heavy [firstname]ght - surveys, installing IDEs, long lectures, tests, quizzes, s[lastname]ge new words like ""types"" and ""primitives"", people having to click a mysterious sequence of buttons to create a ""project"" and ""packages"", dozens of lines of boilerplate code, and so on. Consider how much you have shown before you even show them some code, and how much before you've given them the chance to even build something. Could any of them go home and start playing on their own where the class left off? So I don't think that this is a good approach. It feels like throwing people into the ocean and hoping they figure out how to swim. And I think that we've moved past this point for CS education. Consider Bret Victor's work - https://vimeo.com/36579366 - or online tools like codecademy.com, that let people just start writing code, and start experimenting with things. I really think that is where the value is in teaching about technology. Let people play with things and experiment, and importantly, strip away all of the administration from it - ie. the complicated setup. From there, let people learn to swim gradually, and at a pace that they are comfortable with. My question is - why is this different?"	11/16/2015 20:11	1535		
Student10	Student16	2	"First - love your presentation. You're an engaging speaker, and the presentation had exciting slides (no rea[lastname]g from powerpoint!). Your idea is great too - I like the idea of gamifying it, and letting teachers send arbitrary bits of data. I wish I had something like Pachylearn for everything I'd learned in school. I'm guessing you've come across Khan Academy's blog? They do a lot of neat articles on measuring learning, as well as how to intervene when students are struggling (ie. let people struggle a bit, but not too much). I've been using SRS for learning Chinese, and one thing that I've found very valuable is approaching the same problem from multiple angles. For example - suppose you're trying to remember the word hello (ni hao). The ""test"" question could be several things, such as: 1. Here are the characters, what is the pronunciation/English meaning. 2. Here's the English, what is the Chinese pronunciation? 3. Here's the English, what is the Chinese writing? 4. Here's the Chinese audio, write the characters? 5. What word goes best in this English/Chinese sentence? And so on. I find tackling the same problem (ie. learn this word) from multiple angles really helps enforce the memory. Another thing that's really useful are good hints - sometimes you're on the verge of remembering something, but instead of giving away the entire answer, all the student needs is a small nudge in the right direction. A question for you: how will you incorporate this with materials that may not be easy to test in the application (ie. writing an essay or proving a theorem)? Even if the app doesn't support them, it might be worth considering how the application will work as part of a broader curriculum like this. And a criticism - not a great fan of the name - I guessed ""patchy-learn"" before you pronounced it. I'm guessing it has some deeper meaning. Great work!"	11/16/2015 20:37	635		
Student10	Student25	2	"Good job on the presentation itself - informative, to the point, nice slides, etc. This is a really nice project too - I've thought that containers would be great for education. One of the coolest classes I ever took had us read a bunch of old papers on security holes in Linux, and then they provided us with VMs for Linux as it existed in that day, and had us implement the exploits from these papers to get root in different ways on a real system. It was fun, and importantly I think that it could be broadly applied."	11/16/2015 20:50	113	7	
Student10	Student15	1	This looks really useful. Any progress on an actual implementation yet?	11/18/2015 7:36	74	6	"Response to [firstname], I ran into challenges integrating the eventing library (so multiple events of the same type does not annotate the content repeatedly, creating a nightmare and reason to curate the metadata, but hoping by the time the final project is due will be able to complete."
Student88	Student68	1	"1st: Please don't read your slides :) If you are just going to read them then consider making a summary slide and talk to the points, or include pictures or something for me to look at while you read. Your questions: re: teach an ""adult cirriculum to younger learners"" Simplify the material as much as possible. Leave stuff out if needed re: one site fits all No - of course not. There are many different levels and backgrounds that folks have entering courses. re: right information For your target audience and target experience level, yes re: something I learned that you should incorporate Static analysis and rea[lastname]g error messages or knowing common ones and what they mean re: something that could have been done better more exercises on little things like how things fit together, what happens when things go wrong, debugging, etc."	11/16/2015 21:25	253		
Student88	Student29	1	"I apparently got you guys twice... so I'll copy and paste in: 1st: Please don't read your slides :) If you are just going to read them then consider making a summary slide and talk to the points, or include pictures or something for me to look at while you read.

Student88	Student59	1	Well done on keeping it short. I have to admit I went over 5mins :( The problem is stated very well and clearly. I think your additional categories make more sense and help break things down better. Fiction vs non-fiction seems far too broad.	11/16/2015 21:30	383		
Student88	Student37	0	"Your goals are very clearly stated and help me know what is going on. I think fundamental to usage of this type of tool is management support and encouragement. Success stories are great too, but inclu[lastname]g things like the view count, how long it went from idea to ""success"" and maybe a quick keyword search on technologies and areas that are relevant for the successes would be great to have."	11/16/2015 21:30	558		
Student51	Student83	1	"Mike, looks like you made great progress. Couple questions that came to mind that might help you with your final paper. What is required to create a new level? What setting do you envision the tool being used most. How long should a student be encouraged to play the game for in a single setting? Are there addition activity/lesson plans you see going along with the game."	11/16/2015 20:55	2984		
Student51	Student95	2	"I want to play with robots nows. First off you need to present this to the program and get this part of the AI Robotics Class as part of your final project paper. In terms of your questions. For the body looking around my room I'd probably go with a amazon box to beat amazon to their drone army or a set of play dough containers. In terms of features I have no clue off the top of my head, so a catalog of ideas suggestions to get the thoughts going for students might be a good item for your final paper to consider . As far as my major concern, I'd worry about what happens when the robot runs off the wall or off the table. What type of features physical and software/hardware can be recommend to the students to help their robot survive. What skills can be taught to help them rebuild their bot when it gets hurt. etc... Great job :)"	11/16/2015 21:45	527		
Student51	Student85	1	Looks like you have covered alot of the features needed for such app. Suggestions to consider for your final presentation. 1: More details on the on boar[lastname]g process for both the teach and the student. 2: Details on the [lastname]sition from one semester to another. 3: Details around student privacy included in the Site. 4: I'd review/research the use of the negative feedback and make sure showing the [lastname] face crying might be to demotivating for a student versus a more neutral type feedback. 4.	11/17/2015 13:30	213		
Student51	Student60	1	The only real suggestion I have at this point is for your final presentation. It would be great to see you demo the use of the app from the perspective of two different students.	11/17/2015 21:14	50	6	The feedback was helpful.
Student28	Student86	1	"Good walk thru of the project, however, it's bit long for a typical trailer. I think some of the detail information could've saved for the final presentation. Regar[lastname]g some of your questions, I found program classes that didn't focus on just the syntax, but rather get me to think in the ""code's way"" are more effective. This is a good EdTech project, teaching of programming effectively is a tough art. Best of luck!"	11/16/2015 21:41	589		
Student28	Student2	1	Artimo looks interesting and definitely something I would use. Best of luck with implementing it!!	11/16/2015 21:51	203		
Student28	Student4	1	"Is this your tool or a plug-in? I have seen / used another tool that has a very similar interface, but can't recall the name right now. I think this is a good method to learn co[lastname]g. Best of luck!"	11/16/2015 21:55	341		
Student28	Student98	0	"Making sure that I am seeing your correct submission - the assignment I download has a 3 page powerpoint where 2nd page has a video that walks thru a tool. Is this tool developed by you as part of this class project? It isn't clear to me what your project is about and what feedback you're seeking. If you could clarify that in the discussion section below, I'll come back to provide more feedback. Thanks!"	11/16/2015 22:01	443	6	
Student71	Student70	1	Cool app. I don't have much in the way of constructive feedback other than things you likely thought of. Like making sure icons you are using not copyright protected (unless you own the copyright of course). I think the concept/purpose is really a good idea.	11/16/2015 21:49	246		
Student71	Student43	1	1) Can't help much here as I'm not versed in the technology. Seems like it make sense. 2) You could make levels. I think that some people would want to test their knowledge without prompts and instructions after learning. 3) I don't think the virtual experience is necessarily the most important part of it from an education standpoint. So maybe the option to have snap-tos or other help mechanisms might be a good idea. Allowing it to be more virtual could be an optional thing that is built in later.	11/16/2015 22:05	347	6	
Student71	Student72	2	"Very entertaining (took ""trailer"" quite literally) and an interesting concept."	11/16/2015 22:10	141		
Student71	Student45	2	Very well done. One note that I think you really need to be careful of is registered trade [firstname] infringement. i-Ready (http://www.curriculumassociates.com/products/iready/diagnostic-instruction.aspx) exists as a registered trade[firstname] for another educational software product. I know your name doesn't have a dash in it but may want to (if you haven't already) confirm that you are ok from a legal standpoint. Hopefully it isn't an issue but best to make sure ahead of time.	11/16/2015 22:15	242		
Student100	Student9	1	"Interesting and very impressive for a MS-level research effort. You've developed a very interesting process model for discovery and learning in a very common (and thus important) genre of game. I don't know enough about the theories in play to know how much you are drawing from existing literature here, but I'm assuming that this is a unique contribution and thus very impressive and informative. I'm not 100% sure where the tie-in is with ET. I'm assuming you want to use this process model to help inform better educational game design? No doubt it will all be tied together once you've completed your final paper. Regardless, this is definitely interesting and I look forward to rea[lastname]g your final paper."	11/16/2015 22:05	19		
Student100	Student54	0	"LOL! You definitely took the ""trailer"" part to heart! Loved the video. Glad you added some status to the PDF since I didn't quite get that from the video itself. But it was quite entertaining. :)"	11/16/2015 22:06	391		
Student100	Student35	1	"Technically very good. I like that you are pulling from a number of sources in constructing your rubric. I'm always a little concerned with tools like these in analyzing team projects simply because I know well that project teams are generally diverse in the nature of the contributions of each member. Even with the diversity of measures, this still really seems focused on the quality and quantity of code created. Hopefully this would just be one tool since the tester or business analyst or UI designer on a team would generally be ranked well below the hard-core coders. Regardless, though, as a tool, this looks to be pretty impressive."	11/16/2015 22:13	487		
Student100	Student12	1	Very nicely done. Looking forward to seeing the final product in action and (hopefully) contributing.	11/16/2015 22:29	178	6	
Student24	Student16	2	"Great app [lastname]! I totally love the concept. Being my first time looking at your project topic, I can realize the great poten[firstname]l such an app might have if packaged well and advertised to major K - 12 level schools. You are right that with time the knowledge retention rate is very low if you don't get into a habit of repetition to fully get grasp on key concepts learned. I think its a novel concept that taking a quick quiz in a few minutes to spare could go a long way in consolidating the memory. I think at their age, kids are more curious to try and learn new things and like to venture out more then the grown ups. Making the app more interactive with some surprise elements can go a long way in retaining their attention for longer period of time to keep using the app. They prefer the novelty factor even when playing games, and ad[lastname]g some level of challenge can keep them engaged to use the app. Just a few thoughts, but being a teacher and father yourself, you have got more experience and better understan[lastname]g of their psychology. I think you have done a wonderful job at the presentation. My only concern - Is it too long for Trailer requirements?"	11/16/2015 22:17	1222		
Student24	Student10	1	Great Trailer [firstname]! The application look pretty cool. Very Informational. I actually learned my first Chinese word. The preview is interesting and made me want to learn more and try to play around with the tool. I like the easy clickable [lastname]slation tool-tip feature. Waiting to learn more.	11/16/2015 22:49	48		
Student24	Student63	1	Nice little app for quickly learning Physics and Math concepts. Calculating the perfect angle and velocity to throw perfect Basketball goal was in fact my Calculus project in bachelors course. I think you did a great job with the Trailer. Its informative and at the same time playful. I can see any teenager trying out for quick preview of key learning concepts and at the same time having fun. The only suggestion I can give is try to add some surprise elements and reward points to move to next level of challenge as kids get bored easily playing the same game couple of times. Having some kind of variation helps retaining the attention. Good job!	11/16/2015 22:57	502		
Student24	Student15	1	Nice way to aggregate Meta Tags. very handy tool indeed. I think you would want to keep it simple the way it is instead of tracking user search habits and getting into more details. You don't want to make it more into phishing realm. With time and more data aggregation you might be able to identify the actual searching patterns to provide auto suggestions for tags.	11/17/2015 12:07	596

Student38	Student6	1	"Even though I have no domain knowledge at all about these machines or maintaining them, this project is an exciting one. It's exciting because it's obviously a useful ""real"" project that should improve quality through education at your company. Great job - its encouraging to see all the needs and implementations encompassed by ""EdTech""."	11/16/2015 23:01	634	5	
Student38	Student75	1	"I can tell you have put a lot of work into this pre-registration tool already. The interface is very professional looking. It wasn't clear what problem this project seeks to solve, though. I think I saw something about optimization - is that for the school as a whole or the individual? For the final project submission, my suggestion is to be sure to make that clear. Great job so far and good luck with these final few weeks!"	11/16/2015 23:16	633	5	"This is for individual part. Admin part is still pen[lastname]g. At this point - not sure, I can make it b4 the final delivery. Thanks!"
Student38	Student80	2	"The interface and game are very professionally set up. The trailer didn't really tell me much about the research, but it did make me want to play the game , so I think it accomplished its goal. I played the game and now I feel like a bad person. I'm really looking forward to fin[lastname]g out about conclusions you come up with related to the feedback and game. It sounds like quite an original approach to analysis. Good luck!"	11/17/2015 10:17	197		
Student2	Student81	1	"[firstname], I liked the trailer! Very well put together (certainly better than my screencast). It was an excellent overview of the topic of your paper. I'd have loved to hear more about your fin[lastname]gs thus far, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see! I'm curious if you applied for a dev kit? I know they're a little pricey, but hey, it's AR! You could supplement your paper with your own fin[lastname]gs if you received one :-) [firstname]"	11/16/2015 23:05	283	6	
Student2	Student98	1	"Cool idea for your application! I like how it includes relevant information on college/educational aids -- I think that's valuable given the goal is to help low income students. I really like the idea behind the dashboard. I'd love to see your app after you add your persistent database. I'm also making a web app for my project. Feel free to email me if you want to bounce ideas for technologies/data stores as you implement them. One thing that wasn't clear to me was the division of Student/Parent/Instructor once inside the application. I'm on Linux so the video wasn't 100% rendered correctly, but is it possible to navigate between user modes within the application? Or does one logout/exit then choose another option? Looks good so far! [firstname] Student2"	11/16/2015 23:10	558	6	
Student2	Student4	2	"Really excellent work. The application looks great thus far, and the trailer's both thorough and concise. Best I've seen yet ;-) I'm in a pretty good position to give feedback on your video. My undergrad wasn't in CS, so in order to do well in interviews with major tech companies I studied data structures and algorithms extensively. I've literally just accepted one such offer, so I hope you find the following advice useful. First off, I'd make sure I was 100% on my target user. Is it targeted at younger students, who learn ""programming"" instead of CS? Or are you targeting someone in college/beyond who's a programmer without great fundamentals? The example problems you showed in the video are probably out of the scope of a younger student's education (as of 2015, at least). [firstname]ly, it sounded like your ini[firstname]l target was younger students, but your app's perfect for college aged kids studying for technical interviews. That [firstname]et's also *huge,* and a comprehensive data structures review tool like the one you've presented would be widely used. Second, I'm not sure if you're giving feedback on solutions, or if you're just printing the number of test cases produced. I'll say that I don't think the tool would be useful without meaningful feedback OR well explained solutions. The thing that makes sites like leetcode, interviewcake, etc. useful is the solutions. On leetcode you have the forum, and on interviewcake you have great walkthroughs. Anyone can find stack and heap questions online, but without a thoughtful solution/explanation they're useless. Those are my two biggest points of advice. Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk. [firstname] Student2"	11/16/2015 23:19	666		
Student2	Student86	2	"Wow, great trailer! Really summarizes your work thus far quite well. I'll address the specific questions you listed. 1. Most of the enterprise programming material I've seen is super dry. Too dry and boring for younger students, particularly those in elementary or middle school. It needs to be more engaging and entertaining to capture younger learners. Maybe orient the lesson around a goal, like writing a program to ""make"" a car object? And wrap it in a fun story. 2. No, there's no such thing as a ""one size fits all"" curriculum for CS. Surely you could develop material that got the point across to everyone, but different people will always have different optimal mediums. For instance, some people like having a textbook, whereas others prefer interactive exercises as on codecademy. 3. Short answer here, yes -- I think you're getting the right info from your studies. If you're talking about your teaching material, see #4. 4. Yes, and this is a nitpick. From what I see, you're not teaching computer science, you're teaching Java programming with just enough CS101 (e.g. data types). There's certainly nothing wrong with that, but I'd strongly caution you about advertising a CS curriculum when that's not the course focus. I thought it was going to be a more CS101 type course, which I was super interested in seeing your fin[lastname]gs. In my opinion, there's tons of programming resources, and I don't think a classroom is an optimal setting to learn it in. CS, on the other hand, lends itself well to classroom learning. So if I had a request, it'd be to skew your material much more heavily into CS101 and basic CS theory. Probably late in the game for that ;-) 5. I don't have a great answer for this one, see #4 for general CS class thoughts. Looking forward to your fin[lastname]gs, [firstname]"	11/16/2015 23:31	995		
Student44	Student65	1	Very nicely done. Made me want to learn more about your application. Well done.	11/17/2015 7:07	58	6	
Student44	Student20	1	"Very well done! Interesting concept. I have ideas on how you can apply and gain adoption of your product. Google the following strings: ""innovation award"", ""quality award"", ""quality management"", and ""six sigma"" for background information. Your product could easily fit into a company as a feedback tool promoting innovation and process improvements. I could see it used as a suggestion box, area for employees to suggest improvements to existing processes, employees to submit new innovation ideas. Rewards and recognition could be offered by the organization in return and showcased on the site. I am not aware of any other product like this in that [firstname]et space. As far as a format for the success stories page, look at the flip board format used on mobile android platforms. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipboard. Again...great idea. Good luck."	11/17/2015 7:12	587		
Student44	Student39	1	Got you 2x this round. Reviewed it again. Really no feedback other than I would like to see more of the app in action and any user documentation you may have developed. Thinking you nailed this project!	11/17/2015 7:22	68

Student97	Student39	1	Great progress guys! Is this project hosted online that I can see and try? How do you grade assessment for free style answer?	11/17/2015 8:56	415		
Student97	Student44	1	"Great progress [firstname]. Indeed I agree, mobile application population is growing faster than PC or laptop, so thats make sense to give support in device where student spent most of their time."	11/17/2015 9:03	1699		
Student97	Student20	1	Great project progress guys. You can add badges for any achievements that is recognized and rewarded appropriately by top management. User profile page can be used to showcase their badges.	11/17/2015 9:31	484		
Student97	Student67	1	"Great progress [firstname], it looks like you are ready to write your final paper. I suggest to add a settings on frequency of sen[lastname]g text message to your user, some user don't like to get daily text message."	11/18/2015 7:08	58

Student61	Student48	0	"Sound interesting! I wonder if your data takes into account student ""other"" obligations. When I went to traditional school for my undergrad I worked part-time and was involved with Student societies. Now I work full time, work some weekends for the National Guard, am involved in coaching the kiddos Odyssey of the Mind team, maintain a house, and try to spend some time with the spouse. So this course is not my priority but I do try to make time for it."	11/17/2015 11:13	638		
Student61	Student53	0	I guess what I don't understand is how your ITS is going to interpret the student test results and data. I am facing a similar issue with my project so I am very interested in seeing how you utilize the data to help students and teachers improve. Really nice looking interface! I look forward to the final project!	11/17/2015 11:24	1101

Student96	Student43	1	"Your project seems very cool. I also love the questions for feedback. I designed commercial 3D simulation training software 15 years ago so I'll try to offer suggestions that might be helpful. 1) I think the backend makes sense. Though I would suggest a way to use external configuration files to make it easier to update or customize quickly. In other words, have text files that store the ""questions"" and maybe have it read in a folder of them at startup or launch a single question. (inclu[lastname]g maybe the poster if that's an option.) Perhaps have it launch with some sort of menu that shows the loaded ""questions"" and let the user pick one. This could be in 2D land if that makes sense. Ex: a website. You might even consider loa[lastname]g the questions over URLs so a web page could manage the ""questions"" and new ones could be added by a web designer. 2) I don't see any reason for difficulty levels. 3) I think the key is making the immersive environment disappear as much as possible. You want to enable people to visualize the drink making in a way that matches the real world as much as possible. This way they recall more when presented with the real world. For that, I might even add people and crowd noise and the way a drink request is sent to the person. Maybe they have a ""recipe book"" for the steps. This doesn't mean that it needs to be all ""3D"" because we have to figure out how to interact which is the challenge. For that, snapping things into place and having a giant mouse cursor or whatever that limits choices helps because we don't have to think ""how do I tell it I want to shake this up?"" or ""how do I pour into a glass"". Likewise, it should also make the key factors explicit. For example, ""pour 1 finger of rum"" since ingredient levels is probably important for a recipe. Or allow different types of rum and make them get it right if that's something that would be important to remember in a real bar. Also, it's nice to have the steps, but it's also fun to add ""you messed up"" learning lessons. For example, my simulations involved technicians learning how to configure routers. Hardware would get messed up and commands entered in terminals would know which port you plugged a cable into. The graphics where people fry a router fun. People loved to show that as a demo. Though I also think it stuck in people's minds. For example, if someone added too much of an ingredient, it could have someone complain about their drink. Maybe a coworker could complain that someone put a bottle back in the wrong place, etc."	11/17/2015 11:37	772		
Student96	Student71	1	"The app looks very cool. The only area where I was confused was in the types of video lessons that it would be used for. Though I think the numbers on paper was a very good demo. I haven't read about your project in the past and maybe just missed it in the video. Perhaps just give examples of the uses or a sample video for context. The other question was about the timing of the clips. Using the app in person may [lastname]e this, but how do you avoid starting a clip too early or too late?"	11/17/2015 12:43	8	6	This helps with some ideas on how to better present in final paper and user doc.
Student96	Student72	1	Wow! What a cool video. I'd love to see more of the project. Does it have the same level of polish or will it?	11/17/2015 12:45	166

Student54	Student9	1	"I thought it was rather humorous to start with all the negative examples for your research. However I think that by doing so you setup a natural cu[lastname]ity for the actual research you are undertaking. Also, I'm all for the use of civilization to portray complex choices and compare those to historical accounts of previous civilizations. Very cool research project!

Student54	Student21	1	"Nice. I too used iMovie for part of my trailer. I like the intro and the real life use cases (mostly because I have similar questions as I progress through OMSCS). I think you're project has some real poten[firstname]l to help alleviate some of the questions that I see pop up on Google+ quite often, particularly right around registration time. I think when your project is ready, I think you should promote it on Google+ to get some real use out of it. Good luck!"	11/17/2015 12:28	235		
Student54	Student49	1	"That was a very professional presentation. Good work. I suspect that your tool would work well in businesses where the management style isn't hierarchical and is driven by the developers. Valve comes to mind. My Answers To Your Questions (I'm also just an OMS student): (1) How to improve success stories page? I suggest you focus on the person submitting the original proposal and the developers who completed the project (or whatever it is). Show people's faces. People are generally a little vain and like to be recognized for either their hard work or their ideas. (2) Best Leaderboard Approach? I can see where this would be difficult and I don't think there is going to be a single answer that would solve all issues for a leaderboard. This is a tough one. I don't know of a solution that will exist for all circumstances, so I think the best approach will have some type of personalized utility to it. For example, if your application notices that I only care about projects within a certain department, then show a leaderboard to me containing only projects relevant for that particular department which I care about. (3) How to entice users to use the tool? In the corporate environment, there is the carrot or stick approach. Either one requires management buy in. So find a manager who has a problem that this tool can solve."	11/17/2015 12:38	590

It will be very help for children.	11/17/2015 14:57	806		
Student5	Student66	2	I love your idea of learning by co[lastname]g. I really like the student application. The only thing I would suggest is to use a better editor for your web application. https://ace.c9.io/ might be a great fit.	11/17/2015 15:11	468	7	"Great suggestion, was actually looking for a library to do just that"
Student95	Student47	1	"I currently am a middleschool teacher, teaching robotics at a K12 private school. You are right, my first year was my worst because of disruptive behavior. It really takes a mentor teacher to help a new teacher set the limit of what is acceptable in a classroom. I have always wanted a ""fun"" classroom so I let some stuff go that other teachers would stop. I do know how to retake control easily. It just takes years to become a teacher who can handle a disruptive classroom. I still have my days! That being said, I have used classdojo but it did not fit my class. I think that is because I teach in a private school and one call home (or the threat, thereof) and the student will straighten up. Also I have a reputation for being fun, but strict when the class needs it. I look forward to rea[lastname]g your paper. I think it is very useful for new teachers especially."	11/17/2015 16:03	378		
Student95	Student85	1	Wow! Looks like you have done quite a bit of co[lastname]g to get to where you are in the project. It is really good that your login uses google as a connector. I am a teacher and every student in my school uses Chromebooks and thus have google id's. One idea that works with children in this type of learning environment is the concept of using badges or avatars that they can unlock if they pass a certain level. Kids dig customization and it makes them come back to a website more often. Take a look at the khanacademy avatars.	11/17/2015 16:14	274		
Student95	Student60	1	Wow! looks like you put a lot of work into generating the structure behind this web app. I think your idea to create better groups in a mooc is excellent. I cannot really think of anything other than sprinkle some graphics about. Looks good so far.	11/17/2015 16:49	107	6

Student99	Student55	2	"Hi [firstname], It's cool to see your idea fleshed out a bit. It sounds to me like there's probably too much work to do in the next few weeks in terms of what you'd like to finish. To me, maybe the best thing to focus on would be the first screen--making things a little more intuitive and provi[lastname]g some helper text for what the user should be doing. (You may have already been planning this, but I wouldn't worry too much about the profile piece at this point and maybe save it for a post-class project.) Good luck with the rest.

Student79	Student77	1	"Music was a nice touch. It looks like a lot of work went into making the app -- there are a lot of little pieces to get into place to make that work. A couple of points: 1. Maybe start hol[lastname]g the phone and then [lastname]sition to the phone on the table. Better for focusing and less jarring to viewer. 2. Provide a little more context of the purpose of the app. I saw several functions, but still not sure what need it meets. Good luck with final product."	11/17/2015 19:15	158		
Student79	Student1	2	"I like the way the video and [lastname]script pages have engaging options (note taking, ask prof, ask ai, etc). I'm also a big fan of assignment reminders. The one challenge is that coursera and udacity already have so much [firstname]et share and there is a lot of functionality that would be needed to make your system work. But given the unified platform, I think it is far better than the many different pieces currently used in GA's OMSCS"	11/17/2015 19:19	648	7	
Student79	Student99	2	"Background music ghostbusters -- nice easter egg! You showed significant detail. I think it would be nice to show it as a bar graph with ranges and interpretations. Instead of 'plagiarized' and 'not plagiarized' maybe use 'high', 'medium' and 'low' 'chance of plagiarism' (3 categories are probably valid).

Student81	Student6	1	This looks great. very complex. Is there any way to dumb it down a little? I noticed that the existing training material seems like it provided some guidance (training) and the system you have provides little guidance (from what I saw). I know this is a complicated machine so this may be a challenge. Recommend that you incorporate guidance screens to provide training as well as haptic feedback	11/17/2015 20:12	257	4	I have no idea how haptic feedback would be in any way useful or relevant to the project.
Student81	Student75	0	Your software is moving in the right direction however I think the trailer video does not focus on what is possible but rather the gap you still need to overcome. I recommend you update your approach to showcase your accomplishments and goals and reserve the issues for a different section.	11/17/2015 20:22	170	5	Thanks [firstname].

Student85	Student41	1	"Very slick video - I am totally jealous! I also like the concept of asking for help and getting a response in near real-time. That would be a great value add for OMSCS, I'm here to tell you! I know it's a ""sizzle"" feature for you, but I am not completely sold on the ""expert gets a text"" concept as typing in answers on an iPhone is hell itself! To me, that's not the ""steak"", but in a pinch, it is a nice feature."	11/17/2015 20:27	149		
Student85	Student47	1	"I like the concept - this is something that's been missing from OMSCS courses. I think it's particularly important for instructors to be able to control group membership. Nice application architecture - it seems like its ready to support smart phone clients, etc., which is nice Are there mechanisms for a group to vote on accepting new members?

Student19	Student56	1	"Great topic! I certainly agree that standardized testing is not accurate. In my opinion, it's good to have a standard to measure performance but that should only be the base (or one tool) and not the only thing we use. I also think there's a difference between having a standard and the way in which standardized tests are currently performed. Taking fill-in-the-bubble tests in allotted time periods does not take into consideration how stress can affect the way in which students take the test. It also narrows the students' mindset to learn hot to take tests instead of the content. I think have a standard is different because it should represent a guideline of concepts/ideas that students need to learn, and how these are taught or tested agains can be done in multiple ways, even games! I'd love to see the output of your research. Awesome work!"	11/17/2015 20:35	878		
Student19	Student8	1	This is very exciting! I'm also buil[lastname]g a video game for my project. Mine is focused on teaching children about computer science.

Do you delete them after x days or similar? I think since you already have sockets working in there, it might be nice to have an indicator of the number of people currently watching that same video. Awesome work!"	11/17/2015 21:00	303		
Student19	Student73	1	What a great project! It would certainly help me out a lot. I would love to try out when it's ready. I curious about the technology stack you are using. Are you manually updating the advisor when course/specialization [lastname]es happen? I think you have a great tool to build upon. I don't have much feedback regar[lastname]g new features but I'm excited to use the tool! Awesome work!	11/17/2015 21:05	613		
Student29	Student37	1	"Good trailer. Great, interesting graphics. I liked that you didn't just read the slides. Feedback: how to improve success stories page: Perhaps users could vote on them, like Reddit or Digg? Winners could become part of a technology capabilities catalog. best leaderboard approach: Winner gets lunch. how to entice users to use the tool: Maybe new users can sign up to be developers under training -their submissions would be reviewed before posting. After a given probationary period, they could become full submitters?"	11/17/2015 21:38	415		
Student29	Student87	1	"Just a few items of feedback. 1. The video, in my opinion was too long, can you condense it to 5 min? 2. The volume was low - I had to max my laptop volume to hear it. I, too, had the same problem with my video, and was able to edit it in a program called ""Active Presenter"" pretty easily. 3. I think you project sounds very good. I would encourage you to not apologize so often in your video. 4. I would like to see how your project relates to Ed Tech sooner in your presentation."	11/18/2015 20:52	3809		
Student29	Student59	2	"First slide looks great, demo was wonderful. Great first explanation of what it is - right off the bat I had an Idea of what it's about. Problem statement very clear. I don't have the background to offer a suggestion to your question, but I think it's great just as it is."	11/18/2015 21:55	285		
Student29	Student74	2	"Need problem statement right away. Great Demo! Can you expand on how this would benefit students, or exactly what it would be used for?"	11/18/2015 22:00	405		
Student52	Student99	1	"Hi [firstname], Great description on your project and presenting how it works. I am not familiar with the Dale-Chall scoring system but after your brief description I felt like it was simple enough to understand. This plagiarism checker seems to work very and well and is easy to use. Again, good job on your progress so far and the video was well done."	11/17/2015 23:13	436		
Student52	Student64	1	"Hi Team Code Element, Great information presented in your PowerPoint slideshow. Your project proposal sounds very interesting and I hope that it is able to have an impact as you have proposed, especially if this type of program would help spark an interest in STEM related fields for those students. One note for improvement is to check for consistency throughout the slides with en[lastname]g sentences with a period. I noticed only some sentences ended with a period and others did not. Fortunately, it is nothing with the actual content of the presentation. :-) Great work guys! I look forward to hearing more in your final presentation."	11/20/2015 21:20	2329	7	
Student52	Student40	2	"Hi [firstname], Great work on presenting your project up to this point. I think you did a good job of showing the technical detail that has gone into your project and briefly discussing how the rest of the project will help pull it all together. It looks like you've invested a considerable amount of time into this project. With that, I am not able to think of any specific contributions that would necessarily benefit you at this phase in your project. I wish you good luck on the last few weeks on this project and hope to hear more about the final product. Awesome job!"	11/20/2015 21:59	673		
Student52	Student79	1	"Hi [firstname]athan, Great work and very cool extension! I actually use the Google [lastname]slate extension already in Chrome as my primary helper for foreign languages, mostly German, Japanese and Spanish. I installed the Rea[lastname]g Vocabulary extension to test it as well. In some cases I found that your extension provided more possible [lastname]slations than what Google [lastname]slate provided, which could help in many situations. [lastname]slating a sentence can be interpreted in many ways, so having a list of the possible word [lastname]slations can be helpful in cases like that. I think you did a great job presenting your project in your trailer. If I had one request or suggestion, I would have liked to see the technical details behind the extension, such as the code you used to create the extension and the site/application working in the back-end to provide those [lastname]slations (was it Glosbe?). Otherwise, good work so far and I plan on using the extension so more! Thanks!"	11/20/2015 22:10	754	7	
Student40	Student1	1	"Thanks Sam for your trailer video! Trailer Comments: The action buttons such as ""Ask AI tutor a question"" seem oddly placed (from the video it seems the buttons are above the boxes which the text would be entered into, which might be a distracting UI issue that could confuse users...moving them to the more conventional location underneath the textbox they're related to might help). The text to me option seems interesting (I'd be curious how it would work out, especially for a wordy lesson and how students respond to it). Just to give some extra info from my end, I would say a couple of the items you mentioned are applicable in my case, particularly this semester (where my time was split amongst too many responsibilities). - work and family obligations - not going to graduate in two semesters - isolation and disengagement - responsiveness from instructors/staff I would probably replace with a variation of getting extra encouragement (I'm guessing this is what the mentors were supposed to assist with this semester, but it would have been nice if they were more actively ""Coaching"" and provi[lastname]g extra encouragement, but that requires more time/effort). With your application I feel like you can assist with the last two, but I'm not sure how you might be able to address work/family/not going to graduate in the near future via software. I wish I had an answer I could write for those myself in software, but for the most part those are probably institution related and how the courses are offered more than anything else (provi[lastname]g more flexibility for classes in a self-paced format, combined with course coaches, and options to help accelerate progress by offering courses in short-term formats, rather than full-semester classes, but that also requires more content and material development). Looking good so far though and it has some neat ideas, so I hope they continue getting developed over the few coming weeks of the semester :-)."	11/17/2015 23:18	1991	7	
Student40	Student79	1	"Hi [firstname]! Trailer Comments: Nicely done trailer :-), it was in a more traditional intro tutorial video format which sounded very professional and like something you would see on a company website introducing a product, so well done! I went ahead and tried to install the extension on my end, but I received an error ""package is invalid. Details: 'Could not load extension icon 'icon16.png'.'"" Seems like it'd be something my wife would be interested in trying when learning Mandarin!"	11/17/2015 23:52	456	6	
Student40	Student64	1	"Hi Team Element! Your project was particularly interesting to me when I first read your proposals earlier in the semester because of the community I live in and my own particular interest for buil[lastname]g up a co[lastname]g community locally. From my perspective I guess some of the questions for school districts to ask are related to the goals of implementing or pursuing some sort of programming/computer science curriculum. Is it to build critical thinking / logic skills, or is it to actually turn students into software developers? I think they can easily reach the first goal (using it as an avenue to build critical thinking / logic skills, and provide a way to make certain concepts in math a more realistic understan[lastname]g by implementing some math algorithms as programs). If it's to actually make students into software developers, I think that's a goal that might be a bit of a stretch for most students, though it is good to encourage it and expose students to it, just as they are exposed to math concepts. I would definitely say aside from the district-level lack of focus on this sort of stuff, when a school district does try and implement something like this one of the drawbacks I see is that rarely will the instructor teaching the course have a strong background in the field, which is a drawback because they don't have as much to share of the real-world with the students. Two of our high schools have recently implemented an AP Computer Science course, and I feel that in at least the first school this is the case (I'm not sure about the second school). But I don't see a way to really bring well-qualified instructors to the elementary/high school levels (some creative thinking would have to go into helping make that an attractive option for passionate software people to get into teaching)."	11/18/2015 0:00	1786	7	
Student40	Student99	1	"Hi [firstname]! Thanks for sharing your work in your Project Trailer! It was the first time I was exposed to the concepts of the ""Dale-Chall Readability Formula"" and the TF-IDF score. I've been around tools our instructors use such as TurnItIn and SafeAssign (built-in to Blackboard), but never wondered too much they do what they do (or knew where to start if I even wanted to attempt buil[lastname]g something similar), so it's neat to see something attempting to build something similar. I'd be curious to find out if you know whether those existing products use similar techniques? Another question I have is whether the scores are all that gets stored in the database (or is the primary component of the comparison?) In other words, in order to compare a new submitted document, do you just have to calculate its single score and run a simple search in your database, or do you have to essen[firstname]lly review all of the items in your database and compare the new submitted document's score against all of those items (I'm curious about whether the speed of calculating the ""plagiarized"", ""not plagiarized"" values would take longer over time, once the database size grows to a sizable amount?). I'm curious about it since it seems like the two commercial products do have some sort of processing delay if I remember correctly (I'm assuming because it takes some time to run the comparison for each new file), but it's been a while so I don't remember exactly if it's pretty fast or if it takes a little while. Neat project!"	11/18/2015 0:29	969		
Student92	Student90	1	"Genero, thank you for the lovely video. The idea seems very creative and promising. I was having a bit of a difficult time hearing your speak though. Would love to hear about your wonderful project with clearer volume! Good luck!"	11/18/2015 0:14	61	6	
Student92	Student47	1	"[lastname], I've taught a large classroom before and I'm glad that someone is addressing this issue this semester. In particular, I think the trendspotting and the parent feedback tools would be incredibly useful. I hope that you continue to work on this project after this semester ends. Best of luck!"	11/18/2015 0:15	288		
Student92	Student41	2	"Firstly, I love the exciting music. This would be a very neat tool. I've found that this is one of the core things missing when it comes to distance learning. Are you planning on focusing on specific domains? I almost feel like it would be more useful to do so, since you could more easily ensure that there are experts that can fill the needs of the possible topics, subtopics, and sub-sub-topics. Good luck!"	11/18/2015 0:21	96		
Student92	Student17	2	"Neat! Looks like Slack, for online education. This would be a very exciting tool. I really like the way your interface is designed. It looks very usable. I hope that you continue working on this project after the semester finishes. Best of luck!"	11/18/2015 0:23	57		
Student94	Student13	1	It would have been nice to visualize some of the things you talked about.	11/18/2015 2:27	71	1	Saving things for the journal article ...
Student94	Student36	1	Good comprehensive review of project	11/18/2015 2:29	73	5	
Student94	Student53	1	Very nice fill in the blank questions. How will this bridge the gap of millions of words missing?	11/18/2015 2:35	125		
Student94	Student61	1	it seems badges proved not to be a good way of increasing code knowledge. What are some of the good ways you found?	11/18/2015 2:45	104	6	
Student8	Student7	2	"This is a fantastic tool from what I can tell. I think to get the full impact I would almost need to try it myself but I am glad that you point us into the right direction for a playground, using git, etc. All of those things seem to be really helpful for getting started and from my short look through the site seem to be something that get you started in the right direction. This seems awesome and hopefully this is something that could even help places like technical colleges maybe make a class. That may be ambitious but I like the idea."	11/18/2015 6:14	127		
Student8	Student11	1	"I guess I can't say what expectations would be as I am not sure of the full use of this tool, but from what I see I think I like it. It could be a nice way to comment on certain things at videos such that if there is an error or something might need a bit more explanation, it could be provided. Are the comments supposed to be permanent? Again, I don't have much else to go on but I can see many good uses for this."	11/18/2015 6:19	101		
Student8	Student73	1	"Very nice. I have actually already played with your tool. I actually did it on my phone first and that worked fine. Overall I think it has a strong start and it did predict when I plan to graduate correctly based on my specialization. The only thing I mentioned that I didn't see was some of the future classes. Then again, thats not really a feature. The only two things I might add is something that would allow us to add a hypothetical class that may only be for our advisement sessions. For instance, if a new student wants to plan, maybe they want the ability to add class xxxx and say that its specialization is Interactive Intelligence. It wouldn't have to be added to the full classes, but it could be nice for future planning such that a student could at least have some idea of where they want to go. Or as a side note, perhaps you could add the full class offering from GT but have the ones that are not offered by OMSCS noted in some special way. Just some ideas. The last thing that would be neat would be something like a PDF of our results. Again, I love what I've seen. Wondefully made tool and great UI. Making a nice UI is a skill that I sadly lack."	11/18/2015 6:21	354		
Student8	Student56	1	"Very well done. I like how your project is looking at ways to get around dealing with standardized tests. I don't know if I would say that we need to get rid of all of them...but using them like we have is silly. I worked in a school system and the impact and attention paid to those things is stupid. Where it gets its worst is when we basically have to submit something equivalent for students who are in self contained classrooms that somehow proves that a child with no brain, just a Brain stem, somehow knows Algebra. Its dumb and it takes that teachers time away from actually being with her students and maybe teaching them some life skill."	11/18/2015 6:27	557		
Student3	Student4	2	"Wonderful User Interface you have created. I believe I have left you feedback before, but, this is definitely in the same-vein as CodeAcademy. How do you plan to set yourself apart? Is this an application that you Universities or Business will directly purchase or will it be a free online resource? Also of note, I would be interested to see what kind of in-app support you intend to provide and what other curriculum will become available (i.e. will you develop it or can teachers / instructors do so themselves). Excellent work!"	11/18/2015 6:49	878		
Student3	Student98	0	"I do not think I have an understan[lastname]g of your project. I understand that the survey results are valuable for School Leaders but I missed the connection between those results and the Dashboard; to include the Web URLS you displayed. Do the parent survey results customize student website recommendations (such as College information accor[lastname]g to your example)? If you are creating an LMS portal for grades, behavior, etc., I suggest [firstname]eting it in that manner. To be honest, it doesn't appear that much time was put into this deliverable. This is relevant to the fact that the Trailer didn't accurately inform me of your project. Also, in my opinion, the robot voice made it very impersonal. I apologize for the negative feedback but hopefully it is useful for future presentations. Good luck."	11/18/2015 8:42	428	6	
Student3	Student2	1	"Nice video. What grade level do you expect to deploy this to? Since the app is aimed at retaining knowledge in an online environment, do you see this in online K-12 schools or on a college level such as the OMSCS? The reason I am curious is due to the simple text-based multiple choice format; it might be difficult to populate harder / larger questions on a phone / tablet screen. Do you plan to expand on this or keep it in the vein of Flashcards? Also, can students create their own questions or do Teachers have to directly upload it? In terms of UI recommendations, you are on the right track. Maybe not have the background be white?"	11/18/2015 8:57	453		
Student3	Student28	1	"I enjoyed that this is actually a ""Trailer."" Definitely got me excited about the product as if it was on a business website. Although the dialogue at the beginning was a bit scripted / impersonal, the later-half of the Trailer was quite professional. I look forward to the results! In comparison, I took my Trailer a bit too literally and showed-all-my-cards so to speak. This video left out the gritty details and left me wanting to learn more; which is how a Trailer should be. Excellent work!"	11/18/2015 9:05	503	6	"Thank you, [firstname]! My teammates did a pretty good job meeting my demand without any acting training. It's tough to be normal in front of a camera, especially knowing that your whole class may watch it :)"
Student72	Student45	1	Nice job. Look forward to seeing the application in action.	11/18/2015 11:19	47		
Student72	Student43	1	"New to Unity, huh. You sure have made good progress for having to get past that learning curve. I can relate. Maybe a bit too much detail for a trailer, but otherwise quite informative. My one suggestion would be incorporate measuring of the liquids added to the shaker. Good job."	11/18/2015 11:25	179	5	
Student72	Student70	1	"Nice job. I believe the UI will work well for a child. Like the voicing of the sentence and word options. Maybe say blank for where the word will go in the sentence. I would consider replacing the term ""kid"" with ""child"". Also, consider displaying the results as You got 8 out of 10 correct instead of Correct and Wrong. This could be quite useful in the classroom. Way to go."	11/18/2015 11:33	231

Student63	Student10	1	"I like the idea of using colors to identify different tones. The pop window with [lastname]slation and pronunciation is also helpful. It would be better if the word seperation can be more procisely. Some of the word should be treated idvidually, such as""????"" should be ""??"" and ""??"" . But most of time, the app did a good job on word seperation."	11/18/2015 12:24	1131		
Student63	Student15	1	"The trailer is supposed to be a video, not another written assignment. It would be better if the author can run the tagging process. The user interface looks great."	11/18/2015 12:42	630		
Student63	Student16	1	I would say teachers would love to use the app. I am also developing a game based physic ITS myself in this class. It doesn't come to my mind I should record the response time and other learning behavior from the student until I see your trailer. Great work.	11/18/2015 12:53	899		
Student14	Student40	2	"Hi [firstname], you gave a very detailed review on the database schema, the data repositories used, and your journey in getting the data tied together to now working on the front end. Although, the video was more than 3 minutes, it was great to hear details on your approach and the challenges you faced in your development. Great job. Im sure that your front end will be just fine, especially since you have the data pulled together. Good luck!"	11/18/2015 12:28	160		
Student14	Student52	1	"Really interesting stuff! I really would like to know how the facial recognition will work, especially for people who often give the opposite reaction when they are feeling something. For example, nervous laughter. I didn't quite get what you were specifically what you have done for your research project, the trailer helped me to learn more about ITS. Is there anything that you need from us to help you in your journey? Best of luck! Im sure it will be great - I am interested in your outcome :)"	11/18/2015 12:32	757	7

Looks great, I am low key obsessed with SmarterAP, you could do some big things with it! I thought it was especially above and beyond for you all to give a supplementary trailer to go further in details. If you need testers, I am down to help! Good luck!"	11/18/2015 12:45	295		
Student14	Student18	1	"Hello Hassan, thanks for provi[lastname]g a walk thru of your application. I was expecting a video but I guess the slides could be supplemental - perhaps you weren't able to produce a video? I tried to register for an account on the app using the link provided however, I still haven't received the confirmation email. Is there something else that I need to do? You should add a note saying that it could take up to x amount of minutes to receive the email. Good luck with your finish!"	11/18/2015 12:50	424

Student36	Student13	1	The descriptions and length were good. Did you have any questions for us? I didn't see any feedback questions for us to respond to.	11/18/2015 13:26	26	4	I didn't have any questions! Thanks!
Student36	Student61	1	The descriptions and length were good. Did you have any questions for us? I didn't see any feedback questions for us to respond to.	11/18/2015 13:27	7	5	
Student36	Student53	1	"The descriptions and length were good. Did you have any questions for us? I didn't see any feedback questions for us to respond to. Your app demo was good.

Student6	Student80	1	"Sorry, but I'm not seeing the connection to EdTech here. Fun to play a few rounds, maybe later other people will be on to play against."	11/18/2015 15:08	76		
Student6	Student97	0	"Regar[lastname]g access to a server, do you mean physical access to a server? Why have them download a VM? Just host the VM on Azure or AWS, and have them work in that environment. How long should the lectures be? OMSCS would be a good model. Long lectures broken down into smaller chunks that can easily be consumed by the student. There were piazza posts on this topic as well. Good luck on the rest of the project!"	11/18/2015 15:21	121		
Student6	Student44	1	I find the subject matter compelling.	11/18/2015 15:36	39		
Student6	Student20	1	"I agree that it will be hard to get people to use the tool. In a lot of places that I've worked, people are managing multiple tasks and something like this would be another ""...additional job duties as required..."" type of responsibility. I think this tool would be best used in a larger corporate environment, so there may be additional resources available in a larger corporate structure. In that scenario, someone may have a more significant management role regar[lastname]g this tool, and may be able to find a way to motivate poten[firstname]l users themselves. Good luck!"	11/18/2015 15:43	198		
Student66	Student15	1	"I liked the overall project but it would've been good to see a live demo of this project as I feel I missed key details on its usability. I don't feel like I understood the distinction between the various modes either so I'm not sure whether I can sufficiently address whether there are intermediate modes between those three paradigms. As for metadata that could be collected via the prevalence of web/mobile, location could be interesting as well as what the user typically searches for in terms of content tags. Finally, as to your crowd-sourced model, I think you may want to try a trust system. Most likely, your most active users will be trustworthy and you can pass their contributions right through, only performing occasional reviews. The less frequent users are more likely to have bad information and should be vetted more carefully. That's just my two cents, I think your crowd-sourcing model is viable with a proper plan."	11/18/2015 15:05	1411		
Student66	Student10	2	"Really cool project, I thought the presentation was particularly well done and the tool looks very clean in terms of design. One thing I think could be a cool next step for you is to make some sort of plugin in web browsers which allow people to load documents that way (rather than having to search their filesystem). You also have a lot of poten[firstname]l going forward to use what the user has recently learned and give the user ""pop quizzes"" on words they just recently picked up so as to increase retention of those words. It seems like you are well on your way to success with this project though and I wish you the best of luck going forward."	11/18/2015 19:49	457		
Student66	Student63	1	"I like the tool, I think it will be a good option to teach students 2D physics. Do you have any intentions of expan[lastname]g it? You could really move this through a lot of parts of Newtonian mechanics (like fluids, force, etc.). If you take it steps further, you could make a true physics engine and let the lectures basically build themselves. Good work, I look forward to seeing the final result."	11/18/2015 20:28	119		
Student66	Student24	2	"This is outstan[lastname]g work, I find it surprising that a tool like this does not already exist for the OMSCS given all of the group projects. I could not tell from the trailer whether you had fully integrated with Georgia Tech's various services (i.e. email, course list, t-square, etc.). If you have, kudos to you. If not, I think that is the next step. It would be absolutely incredible if this tool was integrated into the overall system for use in the next couple of semesters. Best of luck and I look forward to seeing the finished product soon!"	11/18/2015 20:30	408	6	"Thank you [firstname]. Right now due to time constraints, I have not integrated the tool with any of the existing Gatech services. This is more of a proof of concept prototype tool. If approved and found to be worthy of being useful for OMSCS courses, then I will definitely continue to pursue the development to ensure it is fully integrated with existing services."
Student101	Student3	1	"Great project! The video was good except for the microphone. It sounded like you were talking in a tin can, understandable but a little distracting. Whenever I make videos I usually have to switch to my headset (USB) it helps cut out the re-verb. Looks like you have a good take on what you need to do. That insurance you have at the school is really nice and I can see how that must be almost priceless. Possible advice for your guide to keep the user interested, if you can videos always seem to work good and like you said keep it in Layman's terms, and keep the videos short - break them up if need be. FAQ always seems to help out a lot, having to repeat yourself gets to be tiresome. Good luck!"	11/18/2015 19:43	12	7

Student101	Student2	1	"Looks good. I like the idea of how it is convenient, secure, and clean. The ability to log in via a browser and phone makes it much more accessible. I can see great poten[firstname]l for this application and how it can become a powerful learning tool.

Student101	Student98	1	"Interesting video, the computer generated voice was different. For future videos you may want to use a universal format like; .mp4, .avi, .mpg, or .flv. While Quicktime is a decent format it requires the viewer to have it installed. Not too big of a deal for us IT people, but just saying in the future if you are show casing a video to a not so tech savvy person. Your project is a very honorable topic and I am interested to see the final result. Good luck!"	11/18/2015 20:03	1769	6	
Student7	Student53	1	"You did a good job on the video. You have been able to accomplish an impressive amount of work this semester. I think your project will be useful and fun in the classroom. Where did you get the questions and images for the answer choices? Did your team write the questions yourself, or are you using data from an external source? Do all students see the same questions in the same order, or is there some randomness?"	11/18/2015 20:49	540		
Student7	Student61	1	Your trailer did a good job explaining the challenges you have encountered while working on the project. It sounds like classifying lessons is labor-intensive. I would have been interested to see some screenshots or video of the tool you made so I could see how it works.	11/19/2015 20:19	352	5	
Student7	Student94	2	The production quality of the video was very high. The music was exciting and was timed very well with what was happening on screen. Your project looks like it works well and achieves your goal.	11/19/2015 20:30	794		
Student7	Student36	1	You did a good job on the video. It looks like you have collected and analyzed a lot of data. You mentioned your project had two components: research and implementation of successful enhancements to community learning. Your video mostly covered the research portion. I would have been interested to hear more about the implementation portion.	11/19/2015 20:53	1820	6	
Student25	Student68	1	"Great job guys on buil[lastname]g a great plan on introducing computer science to such a broad range of learners. I think Java is an excellent choice to teach CS and using a model used in a �Fortune 500� company sounds fascinating! Hate to plug my project, but it involves buil[lastname]g preconfigured virtual machines that students can access remotely. The burden of having to install and configure eclipse could be a challenge for the class, but having pre-built programming environments that students can access in class and outside of class builds a consistent experience across a variety of devices. Great job with your project and looking forward to seeing your final presentation!"	11/18/2015 21:05	49

Student25	Student46	1	"Hey [firstname], Great job with the game! it was really cool to see the progression of the game as it got harder and removing the colors. Also, the fact that you can adapt this game to other matching lessons like the periodic table makes it fascinating. Perhaps at the start you give the option to use a prebuilt game like Binary or make your own, where the user could add up to 7 matching items and that updates the game live without having to update the source code."	11/18/2015 21:14	257	6	
Student25	Student88	1	"What a great way to look at how a class is laid out in a very detailed visualization view! Great job putting this together and i would suggest perhaps ad[lastname]g in dates or a timeline visualization? Then it should model the syllabus given at the beginning of the course... Again, great job so far and good luck with the final presentation!"	11/18/2015 21:25	254		
Student59	Student51	1	"Nicely done demo. I think that you have thought out the basic workflow well, and that your app seems to do a good job facilitating this workflow. One aspect to consider for future demonstrations is the inclusion of a more ""real world"" modeling task. Your numbered-paper sequence did a good job explaining how tasks can be de[firstname]ated and reordered, but didn't really leave me with a good idea of what kinds of real world tasks could be taught with such a system. That said, I like the simple, focused design of the app, and see how it could be quite helpful for its intended workflow."	11/18/2015 21:08	779		
Student59	Student87	1	"Nice overview of your project. I appreciated your honesty regar[lastname]g how you fell short on your original goal of having a GUI. As I am facing having to cut features from my own project, it's helpful to hear about others who have had to face the same thing. Though you don't have a GUI, I would like to have seen some code run based on a real-world input, but I understand that this is tough to demo (I am in the same boat). One bit of poten[firstname]lly harsher feedback: I think you should focus more closely on the course and semester adviser features over the career features. Career advice, even from expert humans, is so hard to apply personally that it can be more of a distraction than a help. This, of course, is a highly subjective opinion, but I just see much more value in the course/semester features than the career one. Keep up the good work, and best of luck bringing this project home."	11/18/2015 21:23	1051

Student59	Student37	1	"Good overview of your goals, which were well presented. I did like your progress update, but I would really have like to seen a ""live"" demo rather than the screenshots in the PowerPoint. However, your screenshots do like attractive and well organized. To answer your specific questions: 1. To improve the ""success story"" page, the biggest thing I could think of would be inclu[lastname]g a picture of the person/team responsible for each story. This make the page look much more personal. 2. I'm honestly not sure if I understand the leaderboard well enough to give feedback that I feel would be helpful. 3. As far as enticing users to the tool, the biggest thing that encourages me to adopt a new process or tool in my own work is truly feeling that it will help out my team in some concrete way. I think you need to focus on how this tool can help specific teams make an impact, and sell those success stories when implementing this tool."	11/18/2015 21:55	2068		
Student73	Student36	1	Well done video - I think synthesizing the data into some graphs that are all formatted the same would be useful and provi[lastname]g some recommendations. I wasn't 100% sure what you are doing with the data so I apologize that my feedback isn't more detailed.	11/18/2015 21:26	90	6	
Student73	Student56	1	Very interesting subject. Curious if you were trying to determine how effective standardized tests or are going in to this with the view point that standard tests are not effective? I think the subject matter you are exploring is very good and looking forward to seeing the final project.	11/18/2015 21:28	240		
Student73	Student7	1	Very interesting project and very useful as well. Thought the playgrounds were especially interesting	11/18/2015 21:32	195		
Student73	Student94	1	Very well done trailer. Be interested to learn who your target [firstname]et is?	11/18/2015 21:37	35		
Student83	Student92	1	"Very well designed presentation. The problem statement and solution are well described. I would have loved to see some screenshots of the current state of the tool, and maybe some video of it in action. Good luck as you finish out the project."	11/18/2015 21:54	1172		
Student83	Student95	2	"Great video. I have really liked the idea behind your project since I first read about it early in the semester, and it looks like it is coming together very nicely. Ideas for body material (beyond what you'v already mentioned): Popsicle sticks, custom glass or other fiber lamination (could go along with a lesson on composite materials if that is relevant to the course), various food packaging, and previously inanimate toys. Other features: This would depend alot on the desired curriculum, but I think for a start everything is there. Other actuators (arms, lights, etc.) would open up new interactions, a range of locomotion solutions would introduce design tradeoffs and optimization, new sensors would be sensational, but all of those would need curriculum behind them, so may not be appropriate for the target class/audience. Concerns for educators using this: Are you planning on provi[lastname]g a well-integrated library (both of code and lessons)? Arduino is awesome and approachable, but I could see it being still a little hard to get started with for a middle school audience unless there is /ample/ support. As an aside, my wife walked by while I was watching your video and says that you get an A for your sweater."	11/18/2015 22:52	29		
Student83	Student85	1	Great video - it presented the project well. It looks like the workflows are coming together. An area for polish in the time left would be making the visual styling consistent throughout the platform.	11/18/2015 22:53	938	6	"Yes, I have a ways to go in terms of styling the app."
Student83	Student60	1	"Nice video. It did a good job exploring both the problem domain, and the solution. It would be interesting to learn more about how the tool will facilitate group formation. Good luck with the rest of the project and semester."	11/18/2015 23:13	718	6	
Student34	Student63	1	"Nice demo! I really don't feel like I understand the project well enough to have any suggestions to offer, but I love the fact that it takes in answers and then shows you what that answer would cause to happen with a little simulation."	11/18/2015 23:12	5		
Student34	Student24	1	"The interface looks really nice. I'm not sure there's a lot of actual science behind Myers Briggs, though, that would give it a good cause to be used as a basis for creating teams. It might be better to come up with some of your own questions about how people prefer to go about working in groups."	11/18/2015 23:12	248	6	Thanks.
Student34	Student66	1	"You did a really good job of breaking down what's happening. Does the program have any kind of option to click to get a hint about the sprite-specific commands that are available? or Java hints? That seems like it'd be pretty handy, but perhaps it'd be a scope problem for what you could reasonably finish."	11/18/2015 23:20	51		
Student34	Student78	1	"Since multiple problems are required to achieve mastery, have you considered having the software keep track and throw out any outliers that might indicate that someone just got up and walked away from the computer for a minute? That might be a way of keeping timing as a useful value."	11/18/2015 23:21	6790		
Student18	Student79	2	Hi [firstname] That was a really nice trailer. Excellent work! I wanted to try your application right away. I went to chrome web store and installed your extension. I selected a word but nothing happened. Did I miss any step? Can you guide me?	11/19/2015 1:25	1526		
Student18	Student64	2	Hi Team You have made really great progress in your research. Excellent work! I am looking forward to your final paper.	11/19/2015 4:58	6699	7	
Student18	Student52	1	Hi [firstname] It is really interesting to know that you are researching on intelligent tutoring systems in combination with emotion based agents. Your trailer gives an overview of intelligent tutoring system and emotion based agents. But I could not determine your research question from the trailer. I would suggest you to also include your research work you have done so far in the presentation.	11/19/2015 6:50	2176	6	
Student18	Student40	1	Hi [firstname] I saw your trailer and it is nice to know that you are finally done with a difficult part of your project. I wish you good luck with rest of your project.	11/19/2015 7:26	1840		
Student93	Student71	1	"This is very interesting. I did not know what video modeling is and I was imagining something totally different since I am coming from background of data science. So far I liked what you focused on and what you keep stressing out -- large icons, not to much content. This is an excellent way to make sure students are more focused (look at the google.com page...it is empty). I agree that you need to collect the data from the session and do some analysis on it. This could be very tricky. The challenge is not in what you can find in the data, but HOW are you going to show it to students/parents without making them very confused."	11/19/2015 10:35	398	6	Good thoughts for presenting user guidance for a user audience that may not be all that tech savvy.
Student93	Student96	1	"Hi [firstname], I feel like what you are doing is something really cool, but I have no clue what is it. I got very confused right from the start where you show a collection of books by Wenger and then you move to managing web design pages. I feel like I am missing a big chunk of context and thus my review would not be fair. But just because I don't get it (there could be multiple reasons to that) it does not mean it is not valuable and not great. I would look forward to final presentation and a paper after which I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel :) I have few questions (in the area where I am more familiar with): -- how did you create your estimations? based on intuition, experience or both? -- do you have an insights of why your estimations were off? -- could it be that it is just two early in the process?"	11/19/2015 10:42	847	7	
Student93	Student50	1	"Hi [firstname], These types of insights are always interesting and valuable so I am looking forward for final results. Here are a few pointers (from a data science engineer): -- those correlation matrices are extremely confusing. Partly because they are too large. And partly because it was not clear what variables are you trying to correlate -- watch the sample size. You might be getting wrong estimated if your sample is misrepresented -- it is good to drive the attention of the percentage of females vs males. But this is a known fact and it is better to derive a reason from the data rather than just show the number. That would be extremely useful. -- also find some facts which could be very curious to people but they would not necessarily expect that -- do not let your intuition bias on how you look into the data -- you know statistics can lie. -- it would be great to make the data interactive so people can zoom in into different aspects Anyway, I like where this is going. Let see the result"	11/19/2015 10:56	481	7	
Student93	Student76	2	"I left this trailer review for last because it was my favorite. Don't get me wrong -- the presentation could use some improvements (and that is a generous statement) but the project itself is awesome. You were featured in one of the exemplary projects and that is why I knew you were talking about in your trailer. I meant to contact you immediately, but then I did not want to lose my focus on my project which is not that far from yours from what I have seen. I am also making inference from the individuals' responses but in a totally different way and for a different reason. At some point I would like to try your idea instead. Anyway, few pointers on the project: -- I would be careful with the labels: positive, negative, unknown --- it is not always very clear and it might confuse people -- Also, the states you are tracking are [lastname]ing too fast and it looks like a christmas tree mishap :) Maybe some smoothing can help? -- Do you have any historical trends and summaries? That could be useful -- How are you planning to proceed with this? Do you have a plan for moving forward with this project? I want to see the final result. If I happen to not the in the review for your paper, I would appreciate you sharing your paper with me. My contact is Student93 Thanks, Student93"	11/19/2015 11:10	665	7	Phenomenal feedback. Both historical summaries and state smoothing will be in the final released product (smoothing was in the prior build but was broken in latest refactor prior to the trailer). Trailer looked a bit unfinished because my wife was going into labor :)
Student43	Student70	1	"FYI, I copied and pasted the url link and got a video does not exist error when loa[lastname]g the url. However, I realized that the copy and paste was dropping the hyphen in the link. After ad[lastname]g it manually, the video loaded fine. Probably an issue with adobe pdf viewer, so not sure if anyone else would have the same issue. For your video, looks like your team has made good progress. The UI seems intuitive and easy to use. My only concern is that the audio of the sentence and words seemed very choppy. That choppiness could just be a result of the youtube video but if not I would wonder if that could cause your user any issues. Overall, good job!"	11/19/2015 11:18	769		
Student43	Student5	1	"Awesome video production! However, I wish there had been more detail about the app itself as I don't feel I have enough to provide any useful feedback. I'm excited to see the final product though!!"	11/19/2015 11:31	485		
Student43	Student34	1	"I have not taken this class so my comments may not reflect the actual nature of the class. First, it appears that extra credit is given as an incentive for doing peer review but few take advantage of it. Based on that, I would suggest that many students in this program are very limited on time and the extra credit may not be significant enough to warrant the additional time required to do the peer review(s). Also, aside from peer reviews, I'm curious if sufficient examples are given of good and poor proofs which clearly point out what is good and bad about either."	11/19/2015 11:39	1059		
Student43	Student78	1	"Timing: I'm not clear from the video what you mean by 'pause'. Can the user actually pause the timer or do you mean they just moved away from the application for some period of time? I don't think you would want them to be able to pause the timer. Is it clear to the user that the timer impacts the mastery score? Maybe directly show the impact that time has to the mastery score, for instance show a ""mastery modifier' that will be subtracted from the mastery score and visibly increases every x seconds. Affect: It may detract from the experience but could you ask for an affect selection between each question or two? For instance, after submitting a question, asking something like ""Did you find that question to be easy, hard, or just ok?"". Other: Make sure to spell check, Congradulations should be Congratulations"	11/19/2015 11:57	1281		
Student41	Student8	1	"Great idea, Chris, and really well executed. I don't have a lot of personal experience with autism, but I feel more familiar with the disorder after watching ""How to Dance in Ohio"" (an HBO documentary that features autistic students). It struck me while viewing that documentary that at least one of the students was seemingly much more affected by things that she had read, watched, or played than by human interactions. My one suggestion might be whether you'd want to provide text feedback in addition to the audio feedback. I'm inclined to believe that a player would intuit that starting over a level denotes some kind of bad behavior, but maybe a short text-based message would also be helpful?"	11/19/2015 11:27	1076		
Student41	Student17	1	"What I really like about this project is that it consolidates several of the communication methods that we currently have available to us into a single application. The use of Slack to handle real-time communication is great. One issue that I didn't quite get was whether students could create channels on their own or whether that was an administrative function. It would be great to make a forum available in real-time that was an active channel so long as participants were using it. In other words, once I logged into Aperta, I would see a list of ""active"" discussions (maybe channels that had been active within the last 5 minutes?). It would be cool to see synchronous conversations occurring around classes rather than just asynchronous discussion threads. Just a thought. Great job on what you've accomplished so far. My project was also related to creating the ability to synchronously discuss an online course, albeit using Twilio to communicate with a SME via text messaging. It's good to see other students attempting to bring a more human approach to online learning."	11/19/2015 11:45	867		
Student41	Student90	1	"That's really interesting research that you're doing. While I don't know much about music therapy or dyscalculia, you do make a strong case that music therapy is an appropriate treatment method for dyscalculia. Have you been able to try this method of learning with other children who have dyscalculia? It would be interesting to hear in the final paper what your results have been."	11/19/2015 12:01	876	7	
Student41	Student19	1	"I remember seeing Scratch using for learning programming here: https://studio.code.org/flappy/1. That teaching method of ""try, test, revise"" is such a powerful method for learning procedural materials. Great setup for understand what you're trying to accomplish. I felt like I was quickly caught up on what, exactly, you've set out to accomplish. It doesn't seem like you have much time for integrating a Scratch-like interface, but I hope that you're able to prototype some of that functionality as I think that's the real ""EdTech"" behind your project."	11/19/2015 12:35	710	6	
Student4	Student81	2	Great Teaser. Would look forward to see your research paper once it is in public domain	11/19/2015 11:53	76	5	
Student4	Student86	2	"My project mission statement is in a similar area to teach programming to younger students. I gained a lot of insights going through this project and hope to incorporate some of them in my classes. Compared to your team I am a novice voluntary teacher and the approach I am taking is a lot different than what you have been undertaking. Rather than focusing on teaching language and syntax , I am following a problem solving approach that is give students a problem or programming puzzle to solve and ask them how would you approach it. For solving the problem I am just covering just the right amount of language syntax that is needed to solve the problem. Even I am making the choice of language optional to students. With this I have seen younger learners more responsive in the class than my first class which was primarily focused on syntax and tried to cover all the features of the language"	11/19/2015 12:02	616		
Student4	Student38	2	Great work! I hope it is in production soon. I want to use it in my classes where plagiarism is a huge problem.	11/19/2015 12:22	60		
Student4	Student75	1	I tried downloa[lastname]g the video couple of times but it was really slow. I am based in India and connection with T-Square drops quite often. Apologies and best of luck!	11/19/2015 12:29	109	5	You can look into the PDF version. Thanks!
Student21	Student32	2	Awesome trailer. Can't wait to see the final app.	11/19/2015 17:32	98

Student21	Student49	1	"On the success stories page, admin team can add how many customers are currently using the product created by the team, how much revenue it is making for the company.

Student15	Student46	1	The work effort is quite easy to understand and a nice implementation. Good luck!!	11/19/2015 17:34	140	6	
Student15	Student16	2	"Very cool idea and thought process. Continuous and [lastname]forced learning techniques are the way to go, in an explo[lastname]g world of knowledge. Interested to learn more about your final project. Good luck."	11/19/2015 17:37	72

Student35	Student54	2	"Needless to say, the trailer is well produced. Similarly, the application looks very visually appealing. Especially compared to command line tools, this application will be a great asset. My only (minor) recommendation would be to go through the application a bit more (or somewhat slowly) in the final video. Overall, I think you have done great work, and I look forward to seeing your application at the end of the semester (or, who knows, maybe as a TA one day). Thanks!"	11/19/2015 19:45	202		
Student39	Student65	2	I could not rate this trailer higher. It's a combination of [firstname] Nolan with the wit of Joss Whedon. I will play this at my wed[lastname]g.	11/19/2015 19:57	53	7	
Student39	Student67	1	"Cool, simple design. Neat concept, pulling motivational videos based on topics is intriguing - giving a truly global experience from different individuals to the user.

Student39	Student100	2	You guys definitely put a lot of work into this and it shows. A lot of cool functionality. Can't wait to see the final product.	11/20/2015 1:57	181		
Student9	Student14	1	"Really well executed trailer. You teased the idea very effectively. I'm really interested to hear more about the research you are gathering. In particular - I would expect an online program (which, basically, up until this very class has been anonymous) to have higher participation from groups which are traditionally said to be afraid of stigmatization. Why does that not seem to be the case? Is there still the perception of stigma - or maybe the idea that stigmatization holds groups back is completely erroneous to begin with - and your research might even disprove that. There is so much that is unique about the OMSCS - I look forward to seeing the results, and I hope it can bring us all a step closer to more equal educational opportunity. I'm in the 60+ hour work week category, and there is no way I can fork over 40k a year for a masters - so grad school literally wasn't an option until now. Good luck!"	11/19/2015 19:53	337		
Student9	Student21	1	I got a good smile out of that. Looking forward to what you guys do.	11/19/2015 20:01	77		
Student9	Student49	1	"Nice work. I have one piece of feedback, which may address a number of your questions. The people submitting 'tasks' should also place a value on the completion of that task. This is different than having external priorities. Corporate example - typically biz dev or [firstname]eting is assessing [firstname]etplace opportunity, and therefore should also be responsible for estimating the 'value' of the completion of a task. Your innovation team then sees a list of tasks, sorted only by value. They then have a choice - do I pick off a lot of easy, low value targets - or go for the big high value target. This creates a 'point' system which isn't silly, because it's actually related to the core value of the work being delivered. Over time, this internal valuation can act as an economy of sorts."	11/19/2015 20:06	277		
Student9	Student26	2	Wow. Great work. I'm not sure what I can offer - you guys left me speechless. I really love the rule based gra[lastname]g system. I can't help but wonder if it could be extended to other course types.	11/19/2015 20:17	163	6	"You could definitely use it just to set up assignments and rubrics, but the automated part would not be there for now. We have a modular structure that could be poten[firstname]lly extended in the future to support other assignment types. There are some other autograders that claim to handle all languages etc. but they are hard to set up partly because they are so broadly targeted. We went the opposite way and solved a specialized problem with the end result that it is really easy to get started and set it up. Trade offs both ways."
Student87	Student85	1	"I think that you have a really good idea that is needed because not all individuals learn at the same pace. I think one one of the best features is the teacher being able to see what answers the student put for a certain question. So if all of the individuals are stuck on one problem, the teacher can see what answer is being entered. To be honest, I really can't think of any ways to improve the system because it's simple and reaches all of your goals."	11/19/2015 20:44	270		
Student87	Student51	1	"I think you guys have an excellent system that can really be used to help students who have special needs and those that may require a special perspective or approach at doing something in order to comprehend what to do. My feedback is mostly nitpicking; but in some areas, there is a lot of whitespace (I told you it was nitpicky). You should try to cover that screen real estate with something. It may make the app look a little more professional :). However, I understand that this is just a prototype; so you're probably trying to get a finished product out"	11/19/2015 20:49	275		
Student87	Student83	1	I like your idea because the applications of it can range from very simple to very complex. The only critique I could have is more of a future implementation suggestion; and that's maybe gui[lastname]g the user when they get stuck on a question in an interactive format. This would bring in an AI component to the project. Great job though.	11/19/2015 20:55	442		
Student87	Student95	1	"It seems like you really put a lot of thought into your project and (in my opinion) out of all of the projects I've seen, I think yours has the poten[firstname]l to really bring cheap robotics into the classroom. I don't have any critique except to continue doing this because I think this is what schools really need to get students interested in STEM fields."	11/19/2015 21:32	466		
Student26	Student52	1	"Hello [firstname], you did a great job editing the trailer! I enjoyed how you presented the problem through the lady giving the speech and the images. This was a great introduction into what you are working on and leaves me wanting to know more. Also I liked your choice of music here, it fit well with the visuals."	11/19/2015 21:09	533	6	
Student26	Student14	2	I enjoyed watching your video. I already took the survey and it was interesting to hear more about the background of your project through this trailer. I don't know if you did the voice-over in a single recor[lastname]g because it sounded like you did and you narrated it perfectly. You had also edited the video to flow very smoothly along your speech and did a great job fin[lastname]g appropriate visuals to match the audio. I'm looking forward to rea[lastname]g about the results of your research.	11/19/2015 21:18	606		
Student26	Student32	2	"Hello smarterAP team, your trailer was awesome! I enjoyed the demonstration and the music and seeing your app in action. I believe I spotted at least angular, possibly Polymer and definitely material design in action, very cool! You are definitely up-to-date with your tech stack. Overall very nice, clean, and what looks like a very user-friendly app. I also liked your logo. And good job sticking to 3 minutes demonstrating a tool, it's hard when you have so many things to show. Ha! I just noticed the front video image with your tech stack. Web development is so wild, we need closer to 20 different frameworks and technologies to run a single app, yet some people I know who write desktop apps with one language and one db tier think their apps are complex. I need to look more into the technologies you are using. I'm more familiar with microsoft stack and I think you have some very interesting ones listed there. Anyway, I hope you plan to include some way to test the app as a demo user, I would very much like to try it out."	11/19/2015 21:29	1685		
Student26	Student18	0	"Hello [firstname], I was looking for a link to your video trailer, but I didn't see any. I don't know if it got left out or what happened here? I saw your test website and did try that out. I think your slides explained clearly what your plan was and what you are working on, but I was expecting you to present that as a video. For that reason I'm checking the leftmost rubric box, I am sorry."	11/19/2015 22:05	558		
Student70	Student66	2	"Hi Tim, Great progress so far, I really like the idea of this tool and so far the execution. Of course there is room of improvement but I think with this trailer you give a very good idea of what can be accomplished. Here are a couple of points that might be useful: - as a student I would probably like to see the set of functions to use (moveDown, moveLeft, etc) and also clearly identify the goal of the scenario. Something like a text box with the functions and another box with the definition of the elements in the current scenario (river, wall, goal, etc) would be great. - how would the teacher upload new scena[lastname]? are you working on the API as well? - in terms of the information the teacher can get, you can probably consider the performance of the solution, and another thing very important in the industry (not in school) to make reusable code. I still remember back in college trying to write code in one line even if it was impossible for me to tell a month after what was that line doing. As I said, very good job so far!"	11/19/2015 23:37	734		
Student70	Student5	2	"Hi iReady team, First of all, very nice Trailer, you are really good at video editing! Unfortunately I have several questions of the application itself. Is that just a portal to post information? if the answer is yes, why do you think your solution would be better than G+ or Facebook, or even Piazza? Probably it is just that the video was too fast that I was not able to read or understand the overall idea, but I guess one of the advantages could be seeing concepts per category even if you are not enrolled to the course yet, like Piazza. In general sounds very interesting so I am in to try the portal as soon as it comes live! Keep working hard!"	11/19/2015 23:55	521		
Student70	Student34	1	"It seems to be an interesting topic, but I got a little lost. At the beginning I thought the project was to help them integrate the class with peer feedback, but then yo mentioned that less than 50% of the class is actually using peer feedback, so I am assuming the integration is already done. So I believe you are doing a research of why people is not actively using peer feedbacks. I can definitely see this information will help the professors to figure out why the students are not participating as expected, so I believe this project has a lot of poten[firstname]l."	11/20/2015 0:16	424		
Student70	Student78	2	"Hi [firstname], I think your project is pretty good and the trailer was clear. One aspect for you to consider is the capability to extend the topics you have by exposing an API, that way people can contribute with new learning topics. Related to the time incorporated on the mastery calculation, I kind of disagree having it there as factor, because in general it is better to always be precise than clicking very fast to get the maximum possible points. Also, if I understand correctly the student can pick how to submit the answer, as an exact number, picking one out of three and picking one out of five. First of all, one out of three is a big probability, second, if you look at the three possible answers and then you move to the one out of five, what happens? are you gonna generate four random answers plus the right one? if that is the case the student just have to pay attention to the only common option between those sets of answers to determine the real answer. Finally it seems to be a native application, how are you planning to make people use the app? is it going to run on Windows, Linux and MacOS? if possible it would be really nice having a web app, which is a lot more portable, inclu[lastname]g mobile devices. Good progress so far, keep working hard!"	11/20/2015 0:23	1193		
Student47	Student19	1	"I think you made some really good points in the trailer. For example, how educational games focus more on the ''entertainment"" aspect and quickly lose focus of the educational aspect. It looks like you are progressing well. The accessibility and ease of play will be key to people adopting the game if it were a real product, so glad you touched on that. Maybe throw in a OMSCS easter egg in there, e.g pressing the keys 'o','m','s','c','s' [lastname]es the background to georgia tech colors!"	11/19/2015 23:34	1121	7	
Student47	Student41	1	"Entertaining video. I think this is a great idea. Will the SME's answers be available to all users on the website publicly or is it 1-on-1? Or maybe the question can be [firstname]ed public or private when the question is asked. I'd also like it if I could ask the same question to multiple SME, that way I can verify the answer rather than just taking one SME's word."	11/19/2015 23:55	272		
Student47	Student17	1	"I like the clean UI and the almost facebook nature of the app (DM/groups/pages all in one), this makesit very inviting to use. Some functionality I would like to see is versioning so as a student I can see what content [lastname]ed, but also what content [lastname]ed from semester to semester. When I am picking a class, I want to pick a class where it seems like the content is constantly refreshed and that the professor/TAs are involved in teh course, so seeing a stagnant history would turn me away from teh class. Being able to sign up for notifications when there is new content would also be helpful. Not sure if you will be touching any of these ideas."	11/20/2015 0:02	249		
Student47	Student90	1	"Interesting! [firstname], I remember rea[lastname]g the proposal about this, good to see the great progress that's been made so far. Will the final product have a component that shows a report or chart on how the child is developing/improving?"	11/20/2015 0:12	322	7	
Student55	Student93	2	"Wow! This is pretty awe-inspiring. At first I was a bit dubious of how ""EdTech"" this really was, but after rea[lastname]g your slide about the possible future directions I get it. If you can measure someone's wakefulness at different times of the day and under different circumstances you can help them plan their work (inclu[lastname]g studying and other academic work) to make use of the times when they are most resistant to the effects of narcolepsy. It's also possible that this model could be generalized to measure attentiveness, which is a major area of research for intelligent tutoring systems. I've signed up for updates on your blog (we're close to the end of the term, but I get the feeling you might continue your research even after this class is over). Happy making - all of us are looking forward to your final paper!"	11/20/2015 3:14	392	7	
Student55	Student50	2	"Not relevant to the subject at hand, but: the production values of this trailer are really impressive. I want to know what you used to make it... When I took the survey I was very curious about how you would analyze the data. So it's neat to see what happened ""behind the scenes"" to process the survey and turn it into useful information. Fascinating that there's such a huge discrepancy between male and female students - my eyes popped when I saw the program satisfaction numbers! The one thing I missed when watching the trailer is an analysis of how certain statistics (like withdrawals, gender split, age split, etc.) compare with the overall program statistics. This could offer meaningful insights as to how indicative the survey results are of the larger population - important because the respondents may be skewed towards those taking EdTech. [I say this with the knowledge that you may have deliberately excluded that kind of comparison from the trailer because of length constraints, with the intent of inclu[lastname]g it in the final paper.] If you continue exploring this area after the term ends, e-mail me sometime to see if there's any way we can mine omscs-advisor for retention data."	11/20/2015 3:21	459	6	
Student55	Student76	2	"This is too cool! There are so many applications for this in the field of EdTech. And I�m amazed at what you got done in the span of one school term - wow! Your trailer was impressive - the explanation of the architecture is deep enough for the final presentation. (By the way, for what it�s worth, I didn�t think the mouse clicks were problematic.) My only gripe is that I found it difficult to understand the ""big picture"" of the course setup piece. It would have been easier for me to follow if you had begun by explaining the structure of a module, the relationships between the rules and the other pieces, and so on. As it was, I was very confused until you demonstrated watching the course. (I needed an intervention! :-) ) In your final paper, would love to hear the details of how you chose these features (smiling, etc.) to measure engagement, and how easy/difficult it would be to extend this system to guess at other student reactions (for example, frustration). Congratulations on getting all this accomplished - will be looking forward to seeing your final writeup!"	11/20/2015 3:37	154		
Student55	Student96	1	"Awesome to see someone working on a Communities of Practice project! I�m a little confused about how the pieces fit together. For example, the site edit capabilities - is this VCoP also integrated with an existing hosting provider of some sort? If so, why? I�m missing the link between the features and the rationale for why they will spur the formation of a community of practice. It was cool to see the uptake rate, but I think it�s probably okay to gloss over the other details of project status [schedule comparison, etc.] in favor of spen[lastname]g more time on what differen[firstname]tes a VCoP from the more typical forum/discussion board/mailing list options. Happy buil[lastname]g (for the rest of the term, and beyond). We're coming into the home stretch now!"	11/20/2015 3:46	179	7	
Student80	Student39	1	"For the narration, you might consider a headset like http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/logitech-clearchat-comfort-usb It will help with the in-a-barrel sound. I think I would have mixed up the narration with the music only main video. I didn't get a feel for what was going on without watching the supplement. I could see the actions, of course, but not the goal."	11/20/2015 6:56	1268		
Student80	Student97	1	"The trail length goal was 3 minutes. It's hard to fit the necessary content in that duration, but going to 10 is a bit long. The problem with extra length: video isn't easily searchable, nor is there a table of contents. What was your goal with the trailer? If you answer that, it will give you a good idea of what to cut."	11/20/2015 7:17	162		
Student80	Student44	1	"Requesting help in your paper seems like a good idea to me. Sometimes it's hard to tell what needs reviewing. Since your objective is help on the final paper, I would have focused more on that than the slide deck for the trailer. That way, you could have sneaked some of your goal into feedback on the deliverable. How could you do that without just rea[lastname]g the paper? It's an interesting dilemma. What is the purpose of the trailer? Maybe focus the request more generally than a request for proofrea[lastname]g. === Looking at your paper === This isn't directed at the righting, but I found the text itself hard to follow. It might be the combination of spacing and sans-serif font. The last paragraph of the abstract uses a semi-colon, is it supposed to separate independent clauses, or is it being used as a list separator? Although I am not as against the passive voice as some editors, I generally rephrase ""There was"" into something more direct. e.g. ""U.S. jobs requiring post-secondary education have increased by 38% since 1973."" ""There is no single source that provides"" -> ""No single source provides"" I notice many percentages in the paper. I feel like that could be organized into something more readable. Perhaps you can incorporate some slides from your trailer? I don't offhand see any typos or grammatical mistakes, so my suggestions are more stylistic and I can understand if you disagree with them. Good luck!"	11/20/2015 7:23	1641		
Student80	Student20	1	"How are you doing with the final deliverable? I'm curious why you didn't show it directly in the trailer, rather than snapshots in a presentation. The workflow and screenshots seem a bit disjoint. Although the time limit doesn't give you much room, I think I would have interwoven the architecture, screenshots, and goals, to clarify how they interrelate."	11/20/2015 7:50	197		
Student33	Student48	0	I think that you had a great trailer. I see that you didn't have success with the age. How do you intend to cover how age impacts the students progress? i like the details of the presentation and I am looking forward to see how your Hybrid vs Online comes together. I also saw the link to the survey and will complete it. I look forward to the final product.	11/20/2015 11:05	125		
Student33	Student101	0	Ok. Good trailer. I realize what you did there was important with putting the book[firstname]s on the abstract introduction and conclusion. That is usually what is used to determine if the paper is worth rea[lastname]g. What do you think will happen if you can't get those survey responses.	11/21/2015 22:00	73	7	"@[firstname], I have gotten back 14 or 15 responses so far and they are more for comparison to my research of the scholarly papers I have read. If I did not get back any or a small number of responses it should not have taken away too much from my presentation, being that the focus is mainly on the scholarly rea[lastname]gs. :)"
Student33	Student82	1	I tried listening to this but with the white noise in the background it was very hard for me to comprehend what was being said. I think I understand the gist of your project but couldn't get a good understan[lastname]g for the trailer.	11/21/2015 22:03	67	5	
Student33	Student42	1	Good trailer. I see your tool is meant to help with filling in the vocabulary gap. It may help if your tool explains the words in the native language being used.	11/21/2015 22:06	54		
Student48	Student3	1	I think you did a great job on your trailer. This is a very interesting idea and i'm excited to see the final product. You definitely went over that 3min [firstname] just a bit :) I'm very interested in seeing how mobile device apps can be implemented to encourage engagement from students.	11/20/2015 13:12	274	5	
Student48	Student42	2	"Very engaging trailer, as father of a 19mo old son who is just beginning to say a few words this is deeply interesting to me. I really like the demo app. It looks very simple to use, and engaging enough for children to use."	11/20/2015 13:16	190		
Student48	Student101	1	Very interesting trailer. I like the idea of improving instructors usage and experience with technologies. I'm excited to see the final results you present. In my experiences through school it's surprising the disparages of instructors knowledge of the technology systems they need to work with in order to teach the class.	11/20/2015 13:20	530	6	
Student48	Student82	1	Very interesting trailer. Being able to analyze essays in an automated way is really interesting. With 60% accuracy it would be a great base on which to build further research and improve the system. How does your system compare to existing products?	11/20/2015 13:30	130	6	Current automated essay scorers are about 80% to 85% accurate (I'd have to look at my references to give you specific examples).
Student37	Student83	1	"That animation is charming. I think you could wow an audience by making the people more colorful though! Otherwise, I'm not sure where you need feedback. You've been on track well since I know I've read a previous one of your assignments. Good Job!"	11/20/2015 16:14	104		
Student37	Student74	2	"This is crazy good, you have blown me away. I imagine this will be a feature a social network will pick up in a heartbeat. Educationally, I think this app would benefit from having some sort of feature that would let you edit/time shift a voice-over, and allow for custom captioning."	11/20/2015 16:15	133		
Student37	Student87	1	"Audio volume super low. Be careful in future recor[lastname]gs. I literally can't understand you. Halfway through the video the audio volume suddenly jumped up to an audible level. Probably microphone placement. Presentation-wise: you should write yourself a script so you don't end up speed-rea[lastname]g out of habitual nervousness. When you record you have the advantage of just preten[lastname]g you're rea[lastname]g aloud to kids, take advantage of that. Tool-wise: You should accomodate for a student's glancing interest in a course as opposed to a requirement or a desire to actually take it. Think of it as a soft-self-recommendation, where the student [firstname]s a course as a maybe and if it is easy to work in.. it gets in..."	11/20/2015 16:18	370		
Student37	Student51	2	So yay I got to review this same submission twice! See my first review. I was blown away.	11/20/2015 16:24	23		
Student17	Student11	1	I think that your concept is great! It would be even cooler if this could tie into our communications platforms (like piazza) but this certainly encourages student engagement while watching the lectures.	11/20/2015 18:49	103		
Student17	Student90	1	I think that you have a wonderful concept. I can tell that a lot of thought and planning went into your project. I'm excited to see how your end users (students) respond and what sort of results it yields.	11/20/2015 18:51	85	5	
Student17	Student19	2	"I was really hoping that someone would create such a project in this course. It looks like lots of effort and thought went into this. I'm impressed at how far you've come in such a short period of time. With a bit more fine tuning, this product looks like something that could be viable on the [firstname]et! What's great is that it's on a web application and widely and openly available."	11/20/2015 18:52	136	6	
Student17	Student8	1	I think that your concept is certainly geared towards the right direction. I am excited to see how your end users (students/children) actually react and their response to the product. Great job!	11/20/2015 18:55	115		
Student98	Student38	1	Great job on the trailer and graphics. It did meet my expectations.	11/20/2015 20:54	590

FOr example for a beginner, it would be even better to add how much of a particular content they need to add. FOr exmaple: Soda - 5ml, lemon 2tbs etc. For an expert, just a list of contents might be sufficient. 3. Your UI is awesome, and I really dont see any need of ad[lastname]g labels for now but for some bottles, they labels may be hard to read, especially when number of bottles will increase. So, it could be useful there. I guess, lets keep it more real. Overall, I would like to know more about how you implemented 3-D visualization, its really cool!"	11/21/2015 0:23	388	6

Student45	Student34	1	"Great job on explaining the different aspects of the study being carried out. What do you speculate is the reason that why inspite of 10% grade incentive for peerfeedback, students still didn't out to participate in peerfeedback. May I know what is the average time need to peer review each assignment in CCA,, could that be a factor of low participation rate. I am looking forward to your detailed report and suggestions for the next semester."	11/21/2015 0:41	1440

Student58	Student35	1	"The UI seems fine to me. If this is to be integrated into a larger suite of tools for gra[lastname]g it would have to conform to an overall design anyway. It's an interesting tool. I'd be a bit worried about [firstname]ing student's just on volume of work, but it could be helpful as a part of the process."	11/21/2015 7:33	708

Student46	Student59	1	Sounds like an interesting idea and it looks like you have finished some code. When you ran the demo I got confused. All I saw was the fiction / non-fiction output. But in the video you state it is impossible for the program to do this correctly. Then why try or why have this be a focus point? Does the program output the categories yet? If I had to guess I would say it does not. If it cannot currently I would suggest giving some examples of how it would work. If you feel like you covered these issues already I would [lastname]e how you are presenting your work.	11/21/2015 16:33	193		
Student46	Student29	2	"1) Complex topics may need to be further broken down. Depen[lastname]g on the age group you need to keep it fun in some way. I think only older audiences are capable of learning from very ""dry references"". Even then some older learners can't focus on ""dry material"" for too long. 2) I don't believe ""one size fits all"". Depen[lastname]g on someone's background they can cut out a lot of introduction material. If the person has no CS background they need every little step and bit of introduction. 3) I think you are capturing the right information. 4) All of my programming classes focused only on OOP. Other paradigms can be successful and shouldn't be completely ignored. It's also good to compare OOP to something else you know so you [lastname]force what makes some OOP. 5) In college testing code wasn't discussed much. If a class spends time on writing code it should also spend some time on testing code as well as debugging code."	11/21/2015 16:37	911

Student46	Student88	2	Looks like you are pretty far along now. Seems like a pretty clean layout. When too many things are being displayed on the screen it looks a bit messy. It starts to create overlap. Very long strings of text seem to go on too far rather than wrapping or truncating and this creates overlap as well. Maybe improve the overlap issues.	11/21/2015 16:53	477

Student13	Student82	1	"Hi [firstname]. I enjoyed your ed tech trailer immensely. It is fascinating that you can poten[firstname]lly upload an essay, convert it, and then evaluate it. I am curious about your use of LDA. One question that I had was - what is the goal of what you want to achieve. I wasn't sure from the beginning directly what you needed. I thought originally that the tool was to create the essay. That said, based on the ""simplified rubric perspective"", it sounds like the goal for gra[lastname]g papers / evaluating papers. This would be what I might focus on clarifying. I do love how you used Azure websites though. I watched your document on display. That said, I was still confused. I see that you upload an essagy and get a score of 3 for exemplary. What does this mean? Does this mean that you have a great essay? This is where I was a little confused! Overall, great work! I look forward to seeing how things progress!"	11/22/2015 0:54	378	6	Thanks for the feedback! I'll clarify those points on the website and in the final paper/presentation.
Student13	Student42	1	"Hello team! I enjoyed watching your project called ""Closing the Word Gap"". Your project that seeks to help improve the literacy of early childhood learners is fantastic. I like how you started buil[lastname]g the tool using the app. The personalizability of it ([firstname] vs Steve), was great. I really like your fill in the blank piece. That was a great example. The fact that you can then click through the words is an awesome feature. I wonder if you could combine this feature with a link or a description to the items there (in case a student didn't know what fog was). The final data collection piece is awesome! Just great work & I look forward to seeing what you end up producing!"	11/22/2015 1:01	529		
Student13	Student48	1	"Hi [firstname]. I enjoyed reviewing your project which covers distributed learning. Asking whether the type of course or a students age impacts student learning. In your assignment, you came up with factors, course types, hybrid vs online, and student age as poten[firstname]lly explanatory variables. I wonder, how did you come up with these classifications? In terms of the project weaknesses, I am curious what you think they are? Do you think your conclusions would have been expanded by a wider survey? Finally, when you start talking about factors that predict student learning, I am curious what methods you plan to use? In general, I look forward to seeing your final work!"	11/22/2015 1:09	236		
Student13	Student33	1	"Hi there! I really enjoyed seeing your project presentation! It looked excellent and was really well done! Love the slides by the way! The fact that you were able to add audio into a powerpoint was phenomenal! From a presentation content perspective, you identified a number of factors that might impact your teachers ability to be successful. I wonder, how will you plan to validate this work and how generalizable will your fin[lastname]gs be? Honestly, your work already feels complete to me in a lot of respect. Thus, that is where I am left feeling curious - the generalizability. Overall though, awesome work! I look forward to seeing how things progress.

I think when teaching adult courses to younger students, it is important to present things in a nicer a more comprehensive way, so the young student doesn't have the much problems with all the stress that will come with the raw and more serious stuff. But I think you should give all the chance to practice it in the real way. Once they start to get bored again give them another shot of nicer and interesting presentation. May be balancing the focus of these two approaches may help. Good luck on these two last weeks."	11/22/2015 8:42	713
