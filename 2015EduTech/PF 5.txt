Student74	Student8	2	"Very interesting! I am currently working on an App leveraging video modeling to teach students with ASD. One thing to be careful about is the amount of development required. This project seems to involve multiple games (or at least multiple levels of a different game) tied with accounts. It could take a sensible amount of developers to pull that off in such a short time! Other than that, it seems like you have a very clear understan[lastname]g of not only the needs behind your project, but also the pitfalls. If you want to discuss anything about leveraging tech for teaching children with ASD (since both of our projects are dealing with that), please feel free to add me on G+: erizoman@gmail.com"	9/20/2015 11:18	398		
Student74	Student95	1	"Great idea! It seems like you have a great grasp of the current offerings in the [firstname]et, and already an ahead start on your project. It seems like this is a huge project, so my main concern would be with the feasibility of being able to finish it in one semester. Hardware needs some good care in terms of testing, particularly when it is going to be used by children. I recently was able to see Sphero being used to teach basic programming. It was very interesting to see how quickly students went from 0 to very high levels of proficiency, and their excitement about it! We need more engineers, and I think these type of projects will be crucial in that endeavor. Good luck!"	9/20/2015 11:25	553		
Student74	Student18	1	"Clearly and concisely answered the questions. Very interesting project! It seems like you have a good grasp on the challenges that cultural diversity can bring to a massive online learning environment (and we are all living proof of that!). How much more effort would it be from the standpoint of designing a class for it to be adaptable to those cultural differences? For example, having a class that depen[lastname]g on preferences could scale the work to be done individually or in groups. I'm looking forward to rea[lastname]g more about your fin[lastname]gs!"	9/20/2015 11:34	396		
Student74	Student88	2	"Great read! It is interesting to see the process of attempting mitigation of issues with poorly formed domains. It areas like poetry, it may come down to the last set of suggestions that involve a human feedback infrastructure. It was also interesting that while I was rea[lastname]g that section, I ket thinking ""this would work with math, too!,"" something you covered later on. My main concern with having a knowledge base (to leverage on something like case-based reasoning) of a poorly defined domain is that you may end up gathering copious amounts of data that really do not benefit most of the students leveraging it. At least for me, it would be very difficult to leverage successful cases of poetry and use them to help somebody else's, unless they are trying to follow someone's style. You obviously have a good understan[lastname]g of the domain and the problems associated with it. Best of luck!"	9/20/2015 11:41	1026		
Student59	Student66	1	"Well written paper. I will say that I am unclear on what the personal question being answered was, so I can't evaluate based on that. However, I do think you present a clear vision for what your game will accomplish, and how it solves some of the problems with existing ""learn to code"" games. I will say that this sounds like an ambitious project. Are you going to be working with a group? I could see this being a great team project, though if you're well-versed in game creation you should be able to come up with something yourself. Best of luck!"	9/20/2015 11:36	441

Student82	Student100	1	Great response! Auger sounds like it will be a useful tool for instructors who teach HTML and CSS. Do you think Auger could be extended to include feedback for JavaScript as well by leveraging jslint? Could it be extended for any technology that has syntax validation? It's great that a lot of the work is already done.	9/20/2015 11:57	427		
Student82	Student61	1	"The paper has some spelling errors such as programing instead of programming. I like the idea of programming buckets. It makes sense that someone with experience in C understands lower-level languages better, while someone with experience in C# understands higher-level languages better. I like the idea of students solving problems in existing software for an assignment. That is more practical as that is how most programmers will start their career - by working on bugs and minor feature enhancements. Very few will come straight out college and have the opportunity to write software from scratch which is how computer science projects are typically written. This is a bit of a tangent, but I view it as an issue of colleges teaching every student to be a leader when we need followers as much as we do leaders. There is an unfair stigma around the notion of a supporting role. By having all CS students write software from scratch for every course, they have unfair expectations that they will lead as soon as they get out of college which is not the case."	9/20/2015 12:04	606	6	"Had a busy week at work and it shows- :end self pity routine.... Seems like [firstname] understood the buckets concept I was trying to convey while the other PF review I have back so far did not. I appreciate the tangent about followers. I just do not feel like I communicated the intent of my answer well; boiled down it is that in my research I have not found a ""unified"" methodology of teaching programming. It is very frustrating. Some people seem to believe there is a unified methodology but my research has shown me the exact opposite with competing methodologies looking for adoption and programming ""boot camps"", list of learnX in 24 hrs programming books, and online courses taking advantage of that so they can fill in the gaps. Starting to doubt that my project could be implemented..."
Student82	Student16	1	The paper is well written but the mentor's prompt was not included so I am uncertain if the response addresses the prompt.	9/20/2015 12:15	208	4	
Student82	Student19	2	"Sounds like an interesting project! It is definitely a challenge to create a game that is fun and educational. I don't remember the name, but the best educational game I played was in elementary school. The player had a race car spee[lastname]g around an oval track at incrementally faster speeds. Words were placed as obstacles and the user had to type the word correctly for the word to disappear. If the car hit a word then it crashed and the game was over. It was fun because required focus, but it was also educational because I learned how to type faster and spell words. If you can get the right combination of fun and learning, it'll be a great tool. I'd love to try it out at the end of the semester."	9/20/2015 12:18	420	6	
Student76	Student63	1	"I think this is an appropriate attempt to answer the ""extrinsic"" vs. ""intrinsic"" motivational component. However, I can't get past the utilization of the two examples in this context. The question from your mentor asks, ""how will you ensure that the motivation remains..."", however, your examples showed that UNIT learning was enhanced by game utilization, not SUSTAINED learning. There is no question that games can significantly bolster approach to a single test - but does it display sustained interest in a subject past competing or completing a game? I think that a study showing sustained interest in a particular subject after introduction to a game could have been a better example. However, this said, the paper was interesting to read and did answer a significant portion of the question. Student76reene Student76"	9/20/2015 12:24	2336		
Student76	Student25	1	"The question was certainly sufficiently answered. Actually, this would enable ""better"" security practice by separating the school's IT layer from the security layer - school IT staff frequently does not have sufficient knowledge to address current security risks beyond applying Window patches. Virtualization enables a consolidated, generally more knowledgeable security team to address common vulnerabilities. The tradeoff is, of course, that more data is available if penetrated. As you pointed out, generally this can be handled by sufficient approaches that render the vulnerability no greater than that of a local machine. Student76reene Student76"	9/20/2015 13:03	1130		
Student76	Student53	1	Rea[lastname]g your mini-proposal significantly helped from the information perspective.

Student76	Student48	1	"This paper is well supported and covers a very interesting, important subject that we need to solve in the near future.

Well done!"	9/20/2015 16:26	687		
Student28	Student67	1	"This is interesting topic. My original idea for research were along similar line. As for the learning styles, I found constructivism interesting.

Student28	Student79	1	"If the target is for intermediate level readers, it could be helpful! English is my second language and from experience, the most effective is still conversations with native human speakers. Have you consider ad[lastname]g a feature that would pair up a speaker with the reader? For example, the reader could read a chapter to the advisor during scheduled meeting and he/she helps correct the pronunciation and understan[lastname]g along the way. That way there are set targets to meet which would also motivate the reader to do proper preparations. Good luck and looking forward to the end product!"	9/20/2015 14:59	954	6

Student28	Student96	1	I think we're living in an information overload age and it's crucial for a community proposed to be able to provide the user only the interested materials.

Student88	Student33	1	"[firstname], I think this is a great research question. Understan[lastname]g how students can learn to program effectively is a great. Also the differences between low income students, who may not have had the same access as other students is great. It may also offer insight into how growing up with technology first hand either helps or does not help students learn how to program. In Question 3 you quoted: ""she mentioned that she actually had to spend roughly two weeks learning some of the programming concepts herself before she could really step in and assist the kids with the software"" I think this really hits the nail on the head. Teachers today are simply not prepared to teach technology and it requires a lot of work on their part to get up to speed and teach these concepts. As a result, getting teacher's help sooner rather than later will help students learn more. I thought I would take a stab at your questions you asked in question 1. To give a little background, I worked at a Charter School doing technology as well as TA'ed a course I wrote with a Computer Science professor. So I have never been a day-to-date teacher. Take the answers for what it is worth :) 1. What have you seen first-hand as challenges with teaching low income kids in the classrooms? Intimidation at technology. Saw many low income students be overwhelmed when using technology for the first time. Some were wide eyed and wanted to dive in however, it can also be a scary time for them. 2. Do they feel that teachers have been adequately trained to teach STEM related classes? No :) Technology in the classroom is not something I see addressed by many teacher's programs. Many teachers I have had to interact with shy away from computers or anything technological related in the classroom and stick to whiteboards and text books. Heck, even getting a literature teacher to draw up a concept, let alone buil[lastname]g a simple power point to explain the concept with images to grow on top of each other is difficult enough. 3. What training would be helpful in improving the performance in Teaching STEM related classes? I'm not sure. 4. Do they think that online interactive training would be more time efficient for teachers? Time efficient yes, however teachers like to ask questions. So a 1-1 element might be necessary. 5. Have any of these teachers had exposure to teaching software such as Scratch in the classroom? Nope 6. What has been the student�s response to using these interactive programming tool? N/A"	9/20/2015 15:00	941		
Student88	Student17	1	"Interesting list of comparisons. I had not heard of some of these before rea[lastname]g your paper. I also like that you mentioned Khan Academy at the end. As I was rea[lastname]g your paper I kept thinking about Khan, Udacity, edX, etc. as possible comparisons. One thing I would suggest is clearly defining what makes a K-12 education system different than a higher education one. I feel I could make a pretty strong argument that edX could be used by grades 7-12, so then what would it take to extend it to K-6? Also does it even make sense to try to make a tool that meets the needs of K-12. That seems like a rather large window of ages to go after."	9/20/2015 15:16	338		
Student88	Student92	1	"I'm not sure what your personal question was :) The scaffol[lastname]g part was excellent.

If you haven't seen this graphic of Bloom's taxonomy, you should check it out: http://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching-resources/effective-practice/revised-blooms-taxonomy/ Overall I like your concept and methods to teach!"	9/20/2015 15:24	355		
Student88	Student22	1	"I am so glad you choose to write about humor, as it has made this very enjoyable to read :) The for/four loop gag was hilarious and it is something I am going to use on my co-workers! re: question 4 and the items you keep track of and test them on. Those are some great statistics. I had a professor in college who would keep track of who finished exams and when. She did this for years, nearly a decade and could always tell, with pretty good certainty, what grade some would get. Knowing the age of your audience is huge. I have a director at work, in his 50s, who constantly reference popular culture before I (28) or my interns (16-23) were born. Everyone is polite, but it definitely can be a turn off for the youngest interns."	9/20/2015 15:24	901		
Student93	Student61	1	"This is a good reflection on the subject on teaching second language, however, in my opinion it does not answer the posed question. Your mentor seems to be interested in hearing about pros and cons in approaches and, besides a mention that there exist such, I did not find explicit discussion on this topic. There are few things that I would have done differently: 1. Be very explicit of what exactly is a different approach from ""Hello world"" 2. Construct a table to compare and contrast the approaches 3. Reorganize the section titles - they are confusing. For example ""Teaching Methodology, History of Programming Languages "" --- is it about teaching methodology or history of programming languages? It would have been more clear to title it as ""Learning by Example Methodology"". Pretty much each section could have had more descriptive title. 4. What is the relevance of the IEEE and ACM here -- the images of the programming buckets did not make much sense to me. 5. 'Conclusion' section is pretty interesting, but it does not conclude anything. It poses a lot of good questions though, so it is more like to be a ""discussion"" section. There are more aspects that I would [lastname]e, however the main idea is: Your content is good, but it is not well organized to be properly received by reader (and I read it three times)."	9/20/2015 14:44	2031	6	"Yes the organization [lastname]ed from what I originally intended, long week at work. It would have been nice to have more time for the personal question but there was not much opportunity to work on it before hand (as opposed to other assignments); -end of self pity routine... Her interpretation of the question seem's to differ from mine. For me I interpreted it as ""hello world"" being taught either by example https://gobyexample.com/hello-world or by lecture. That was the two methodologies I tried to approach but as you delve further into a language you lose aspects between a procedural language and object orientated. My research unearthed a plethora of differing opinions with no real consensus. That was part of the point with the IEEE vs ACM approach. My conclusion is that I am more frustrated than ever. I could have taken the easy route and state I want to do constructionism or some other stuff but the fact is my project has a serious flaw that I need answered and the question has made me take a long hard look at that. I may be able to execute it but I need to figure out how to compare and measure programming ""levels"" of expertise. A simple badge based system as I ini[firstname]lly proposed doest seem to adequately capture needed metrics to allow a student to [lastname]sfer knowledge from language X to Y by analogy or chunking as I originally hoped."
Student93	Student82	1	"Your answers are very well organized and to the point which made it very easy to estimate the completeness of your response. Rea[lastname]g the summary of existing approaches is extremely well done and it brought me quickly up to speed with the project you are proposing. I have to say the project is not easy and I hope you have a team? Do you? :) I recently came across the paper about the skip through vectors (however I was not very interested in essay gra[lastname]g so I didn't pay much attention to it). From what I have seen though, it should work -- at least proof of concept should be doable. Your mentor posed a good set of questions which when answered very thoroughly can culminate in the project proposal and I see you kind of starting laying down the foundation for that. The only thing that I would have expanded in this assignment is more detailed discussion on the limitation. That is always where the devil is. Good luck."	9/20/2015 15:19	1424

First of all, I liked the truisms included in your response -- very well done and very relevant on how are you going to compete with giants in the [firstname]et (you are very brave btw) Your very first truism is about complexity being the enemy of the success, however looking at your technology stack does not necessarily makes me think of simplicity. Are you sharing the load with a team? I think you should, otherwise the goal is too ambitious. Your response is very detailed and I enjoyed rea[lastname]g it. For thoroughness, A+. You have addressed your ways of battling the competition, however, I think you are missing more details on other questions like ""What is the level of success of the competitors and what is hol[lastname]g them back"".

In short, they are: - cost prohibits many schools from installing sufficient computing resources to run ""real"" electronic curriculum - existing products are not truly designed as electronic curriculum but are more akin to aids, which while interesting, are not the same thing at all - existing products do not consider themselves - and are not - central to the daily work and asssessment of students - they have not won over teachers in the field"
Student93	Student5	1	Good answers to very good question. I am an example of a very motivated student and I started using MOOCs with their very first offering of the ML course with Andrew Ng. But even being motivated does not guarantee that I will complete the course. The main problem that I was seeing personally was not lack of the community of participation. My issue was that I did not have a personal mentor and I ended up signing to way more courses that I can handle. Having someone guide you through the path of learning by recommen[lastname]g your the best matching courses would have helped. The mere volume of sudden availability of high quality courses became overwhelming. I believe the Udacity nanodegree program is a right way to go. Additionally your suggestion on course preparation would be really helpful in estimating the effort required for the class.	9/20/2015 16:02	917

You mention binary and other number systems. are you going to focus on octal and hex, or make your game gen[firstname] so that it could handle any base of number?

Student6	Student39	1	"I had a strong reaction to your project, both positive and negative. I wonder if my negative reaction to your work is because I am a digital immigrant and not a digital native. I guess it really depends on the age at which some of the technology you propose is brought into the educational process. I think a disadvantage that was missed was the fact that as technology [lastname]es, the teacher will have to modify their lesson plan to accommodate. You are also assuming that teachers are comfortable with technology and are able to adapt to new technology. If your premise that the digital immigrant is at a disadvantage to the digital native, then the teacher has even more work to do to overcome the digital knowledge divide. To switch things up a bit, I'd like to focus on the formatting. I'm not sure why, but 3/4 of the paper has a slight gray background to the text, but the remainder of the document has a plain white background. The gray background made the text difficult to read and was distracting. There were some minor grammar issues that would be good to clean up on a final proposal. Good luck!"	9/20/2015 21:49	11		
Student6	Student60	1	"I'm honestly wavering between a ""No, it did not meet my expectations"" and ""Yes, it did meet my expectations"". The table layout to provide the information allowed for easy comparison between the study group types and the issue being discussed. But the table structure imposed a more superficial comparison of the group types, as less information could be provided in a readable format. The insights and challenges section was very light on detail. I would argue that points 4 and 5 are not really insights. The challenges section should have had its numbering restart at #1. The challenges are not listed as challenges, but as high level problem/solution statements. For example Challenge 6 (#1) could be rewritten as: 1. Determining individual levels of motivation. Individual motivation levels have a significant affect on the performance of the group as a whole for Project Group (open) and Project Group (closed) <citation needed> This would allow for a separate solution section that would allow you to discuss your solution to the problem in greater detail.

I think you might have been better served with less questions so that you could delve into greater detail on those specific questions, but I guess that's a critique for the advisor and not for you. I know I would have liked more detail on one or responses, but you have done well answering all at a high level. You raise an interesting point in your discussion on the familiarity with the Google Cardboard platform, and use some districts' use of the Chromebook as a way to bridge that gap.

Student72	Student55	2	Your paper was refreshingly easy to read. Having some sort of system in place to advise students in the OMSCS program is certainly needed. I sure wish I had had an advisor to talk to when I was applying to this program. I think it would have helped me with my expectations for how this program would benefit me and how much time and energy would be required. Good paper.	9/21/2015 16:11	1879		
Student36	Student101	1	"I think you did a good job of addressing the question and backing up your responses with data and references, but I think you need to work on formatting your assignments in a clearly sectioned and organized way. The tabbing became excessive around your comments. The typical informative paper would use no tab on the start of a paragraph, but leave a line of space. I used to tab on novel writing, but with charts and block quotes, it can be a little much.

Student83	Student73	1	This paper does a great job of answering the questions posed. It would have been helpful to have the project mini-proposal attached for a reference of what your goals are to put the questions and answers in context.

I asked Dr [lastname] a similar question as one of my first questions about the system, and really our goal is to solve this problem first and then find ways to extend from there later.

Student83	Student99	1	"I think that this is well on its way to addressing the questions posed. It seems like this tool would rely on differences in writing between assignments to detect that plagiarism has occurred. What if a plagiarist uses the same ghost writer for all of their assignments? For template code, I think that automatic removal (as you mentioned by parsing the template code and omitting it from the student samples) is necessary for acceptance of the tool. Manual stripping of template code would be too onerous for the user."	9/21/2015 22:44	1211	6	Thanks for the feedback--planning to simplify to the following: -Only essays -First two essays submitted assumed to be written by alleged author -Third (randomly) written by alleged or ghost-written

I have some experience dealing with non profit education institutions and it does seem that money usually gets thrown around to get technology. However, concrete planning to use this technology is often absent. In regards to teachers adopting technology: I feel that teachers are already so overwhelmed with so much to do. I think if we build a case that technology can assist them in reducing their work load and show them how easy that is, more of them will adopt to technology"	9/21/2015 11:52	599	5	Noted on teachers better utilizing technology.

I think perhaps it should be a staggered approach. Doing pilot for one grade, measuring results, and then working with the feedback to improve your product. I think some schools (perhaps private) may also use this as a selling point for parents? Or perhaps you can build value of this amongst group of parents in school, buil[lastname]g a case for it to be used in school?

But i also see value in struggling and coming up with answers myself. Perhaps there is value in both. I think the biggest obstacle would be the shear number of such questions. I would imagine that some how you would have to categorize these questions into areas of importance and only channel those to the SME which truly he or she has knowledge to answer? Perhaps you would also have to automatically assign urgency to the questions? Perhaps based on how many participants vote this as an SME question?"	9/21/2015 12:55	13	6

Instead, the paper lists ""best wishes"" and a way of going towards obtaining them. For instance, the sentence that starts ""Allowing easier access to the program will give it..."" it is not specific on the details by which the program will allow easier access.

Student18	Student17	1	Hi [firstname] You have proposed a very ambitious project. I am very much inspired by your aim. You mentioned that the major difference between your idea and Udemy is a cost factor. Your model is completely free but Udemy is not completely free. How do you think your model is going to survive and sustain in the [firstname]etplace without any running costs? Besides Udemy also has completely free model. If instructors want to publish their course for free they can host and offer them without any charges and neither their students have to pay for them. https://support.udemy.com/customer/portal/articles/1609093-instructor-revenue-share?b_id=3213 Also I am thinking why do you want to create a new LMS system from scratch. There are many open source LMS systems (e.g. Open edX) and you could use them. Contributing your idea (problem based learning) to one of these open source systems will be really nice. One more point. Your mentor has asked for a small-scale proof of concept and you have not mentioned it in the assignment.	9/21/2015 12:41	2108		
Student18	Student88	1	"Hi [firstname] Your idea for designing intelligent feedback tool in poorly formed domains is absolutely great. I didn�t know about Bloom�s Taxonomy before and learned about it from your paper. You have presented many learning challenges in poorly formed domains and designing a feedback tool in such domains also presents many challenges. Like you mentioned that there are many learning paths in such domains, and for an AI to identify which path students are following to provide constructive feedback presents a big problem. Second challenge is the time required for such systems to evolve and build knowledge base in various domains. It could take months (if not years) for such tools to get mature enough to qualify for testing in real environments. Third challenge is the acceptance of such tool in learning environments. I am not sure how much instructors and students will be comfortable is accepting critique & judgement of an AI tool over their own."	9/23/2015 3:34	132		
Student18	Student22	1	Hi Jim I get the idea that your project is about exploring the differences in the learners from two different age/experience categories i.e. middle age school and professional programmers. You also mentioned various parameters that could be considered in measuring the effectiveness of your solutions. But I did not get the idea of solution under discussion here. Is your solution about designing instructions that could address both groups at the same time? Or Is it just about highlighting the similarities and differences? Or Humor as an aid to learning is the solution and you are reflecting here about measuring its effectiveness? Can you please comment in the discussion portion of this assignment? Thank you.	9/24/2015 4:27	96		
Student18	Student92	1	Hi [firstname] You have presented a good overview of your project. As you have not provided your personal questions it was difficult to understand which specific questions you are trying to answer here. Your idea of spaced repetition for learning reminds me my experience with Khan Academy. I think they are using similar techniques to [lastname]force math concept. Learning about Khan Academy might help you in buil[lastname]g a model for your own tutoring system. http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable	9/24/2015 10:31	86		
Student96	Student52	1	"Your question blows my mind a little. It wouldn't occur to me the types of things that can be done. Though I think there is a great deal of value here. It reminds me of a video analysis service I heard advertised on NPR last year. They would setup cameras in stores and monitor the ""smiles"" of customers. To me, it sounded like a ""trojan horse"" to get cameras tracking people on a deeper level than smiles. Though it makes me wonder if this sort of technology could be used. Also, I think some digital cameras can time the photo for when someone is smiling. Obviously they have limited processing power. I hope to read about your project later in the semester to see what you come up with. Good luck!"	9/21/2015 15:06	362	7	
Student96	Student67	1	"Your project sounds really interesting. I learned a little just rea[lastname]g about the two motivational styles that you described. It'll be interesting to see what you learn with more research. In case it is useful, I wanted to mention a book on game design. The idea is that it lists 50 different aspects (lenses) to look at in a game to make it ""engaging"". I bought a copy many years ago and have flipped through for ideas of make my software more engaging. ""The Art of Game Design: A book of lenses"" by Jesse Schell"	9/21/2015 15:12	264	6

Student22	Student92	2	"Hi [firstname], Good paper, very academic. Your idea for an intelligent tutoring system is good I understand the concept of Code Academy and the idea of [lastname]forcing the material by essen[firstname]lly circling the wagons again back to older material to [lastname]force. By doing so you get to move forward as you have a better foundation. A major problem in teaching computer science (speaking as a teacher myself) is that chucking the information doesn't allow them to see how it all fits together similar to what you said about the trees and the forest. An all encompassing final project for example that would tie these different distinct chunks together is often quite useful. I agree with many of the fin[lastname]gs of Hermann Ebbinghaus about experience and learning, I also know that it is difficult to move a student along if they missing something important - yet we often do that. The net result being of course that they often become more confused and we have wasted time on both the student and teacher - having a way (automated if possible) to prevent being pushed along I believe is a good idea. Your [firstname]ghting of new and older material is also a valid approach."	9/21/2015 17:52	734		
Student22	Student33	1	"Good paper [firstname], Tracking and measuring progress with Tinker and Scratch is a good idea. What I like particularly about your paper is a problem that I have also seen in high schools - the teachers have to be prepared to teach subjects such as computer science - even if at a simplistic level. Teaching children from low income households can be difficult as I have seen similar problems in which they have the latest smartphones phones but no real computer learning access at home except maybe internet. In other words they play but they don't produce and that's unfortunate - of course I want to be careful here because I don't want to overgeneralize it is just a trend that I have noticed personally. I'd be interested in seeing the responses of your students from the surveys."	9/21/2015 18:04	665		
Student22	Student1	2	"Hi Sam, Talk about hitting the [firstname] - for older nontraditional students (such as myself). I can sympathize with many of the points made in your report, distractions, time constraints, isolation, lack of timely feedback all can lead to frustration and dropping out of a course. If you can identify the factors that cause some of this and possible ""SOLUTIONS"" even if only par[firstname]lly effective would be helpful. For example I had a difficult programming problem in another Georgia Tech course that I couldn't solve and I really couldn't get an answer or good timely feedback from my instructor on Piazza - I felt so isolated (even after I eventually solved it). Perhaps you've had a similar experience and could collaborate on that in your proposal. Another thing that you mention is stringency of assignments and deadlines, a class I've taken in Georgia Tech allows you up to five days of late assignments spread out over the course a semester (i.e. One assignment 5 days late no penalty, or 5 assignments all one day late no penalty). To me this is a reasonable solution because people have all kinds of things going on their lives and sometimes schedules can very much conflict, you may want to explore that as well."	9/21/2015 18:15	501	7	
Student22	Student98	2	"Hi [firstname], Your paper sounds like it was written by a teacher who has been there! - (I teach myself). Your thoughts about data analytics and the Method schools in California were quite enlightening. Student placement is so important you don't want to bore students and then again you don't want to leave students ""behind in the dust"" so to speak. I like your statistics especially about graduation rates and career salaries. One thing that we do need to be aware of are concerns around data privacy as these must be paramount - except when dealing with an individual student/teacher relationship I would think the other data would need to be anonymized. In your report one item in particular stuck out to me; the idea that the better educated one is the better outlook they have on life in general and are less likely to be involved in activities that lower the quality of life. Good job!"	9/21/2015 18:24	1281	6	[firstname] provided feedback that pointed out the negatives and positives of the paper.

Student85	Student19	1	"Nice write-up! In terms of implementation, will you show code samples correspon[lastname]g to the visual imagery? I think that would be cool, especially if the player had the opportunity to select the language rendered. As a programmer myself, I'm always interested in code, but it struck me that your game might make a good tool for teaching electrical circuit design. That could be even better than programming! In your discussion of the educator session, will you provide a way for the teachers to see the student's work in near real-time? That would be cool!"	9/21/2015 19:24	947

An accurate essay/short-answer auto-grader would certainly benefit the OMSCS program and its students, so I applaud the effort. The only meaningful question I have is whether your project is able to distinguish quality writing from sub-par, in terms of English grammar, essay structure, and so forth. Obviously this is more subjective than other parts of a technical writing analysis tool and what's usually used to separate the A's from the B's. Good luck!"	9/22/2015 22:54	514	6	"Ideally it would, however gra[lastname]g the lower-level traits is not the focus of my research since that is something I feel has been flushed out pretty well. I'm going to put in some basic lower-level trait handling and *maybe* go as far as to add support for detecting cohesion. The main focus will be on detecting thoughts via semantic relatedness. You are one hundred percent correct though that supporting evaluation of lower-level traits is necessary if it were to be used for the OMS CS program."
Student85	Student61	1	"As a person who has made the [lastname]sition from COBOL to C to C++ to VIsual Basic to Java to C# to Groovy to JavaScript, I'm intrigued by your idea. I agree it could be a helpful tool to get started in a new environment - as long as the tool keeps pace with the best practices in the languages it covers. By that I mean that Python and C# and Java are constantly evolving. The optimal [lastname]slation from one to the other will vary over time, so this project cannot be a ""one and done"" - it will need constant upkeep to stay relevant. Best practices are tricky as well. It isn't enough to [lastname]slate if statements and while loops between languages - more depth is needed, such as selecting from a dictionary, iterating over a gen[firstname] list, data type conversion/coercion, etc. You can definitely make a success of your project, given the time and energy needed to go deep into the subject matter. Good luck!"	9/22/2015 23:02	619	6	I have been having trouble delineating best practices and buzz words. Seems like one of the hardest and most ethereal parts of this tool is the actual criteria to evaluate the code.

What wasn't as clear was what subject matter you plan to focus on and how precisely your content will be directed toward learners. What is the relationship of your project to the standard K-12 curriculum? Is participation mandatory or voluntary? Do you see this application as a central part of education delivery?

Back in school I build a HMM for guessing the identity of someone typing, and it worked very well with very little training, so I have no doubt that the system would work. I like too that it seems to generalize, and it might be interesting to see if you can do something similar using a phone keyboard (since people seem to be by and large moving away from physical keyboards). I'm very interested in seeing where you can take this - I think that the approach can probably generalize even beyond identifying disorders. A bit of critical feedback on your report - what is Figure 2 (referred to on page 3)? Also I still don't really understand what the X axis is on your chart in Figure 1.

Anyway, some thoughts on this: you get what you measure. For example, if you reward commits you'll get more commits - but not necessarily better code. If you reward fewer bugs per month, you'll get less ambitious projects, and so on. How do you create a gamified system where people don't... game the system? Especially if the rewards are financial, there will be big incentive to do just that. Also your point about this system buil[lastname]g intrinsic motivation seems to contradict your point about children getting less enjoyment out of things that they are rewarded on. Likewise, at least in programming work, it seems difficult to write a program quantifying quality of work - how can a system compare someone who wrote 5000 lines of code to ship an awesome feature to someone else who spent two months fin[lastname]g a very subtle system bug, but writing only 100 lines of code in the process? Overall I think that the big thing to worry about is accidentally creating perverse incentives (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive) in such a system. Anyway, that's what came to mind rea[lastname]g this.

Ideally your tool could track their progress and give valuable feedback not only to the individual students but to OMSCS as a whole. I also think a follow up personal question (at least in my mind) would be ""Describe the incentive a student has to use your tool."" Convince me, as a student, that using your tool has added value. I do like the idea of letting students collaborate and contribute back to the tool in some meaningful way. That could allow relevance as time goes on.

Student71	Student41	1	"I agree that real or near real time responses to questions would be very beneficial. Of course the problems of time zones, number of instructors available to respond, size of classes, etc... create some pretty big barriers. I would say that, similar to bricks and mortar, SME availability is still often within certain time frames and subject to scheduling. It would be interesting to experiment with various windows of ""question and answer"" time using a chat session of some kind. My employer has tools we use for just such activity during working hours. We will set up chat rooms that we leave open all day and can respond to or ask questions as we go. There isn't always an immediate reply, but eventually someone will chime in. The difference between that type of tool and a message board is it sits on a status bar and alerts us to activity. Far more active a tool."	9/21/2015 23:01	5306	6

Student71	Student77	1	"If we look at passive engagement, I equate that to ""listening"" and ""note taking"" if this were an on campus, traditional course vs. a MOOC. One of the things I like about online courses is the ability to review posts in forums and better understand them before opening my digital mouth. Of course one can still end up with a foot in that digital mouth, the times I've spoken before engaging brain were more numerous when real time. None the less, I do think passive learning is very important in the equation and would suggest that there may be a ""sweet spot"" of passive+active together. I'm not sure how that could be measured successfully unless perhaps those who reply to a post earn clout as both passive and active vs. those who mostly start posts. Both are critical to the community for learning, just wonder which, if either, adds more value."	9/24/2015 19:41	1350		
Student40	Student41	1	"Hi [firstname]! I especially liked the paragraph on the Socratic method :-). One interesting tool that I've seen recently being used in this Online Education Ini[firstname]tive within California that we're helping to pilot at Imperial Valley College is one called ""NetTutor"". The interesting thing to me is that they staff their company with tutors that have Bachelors (and in some cases, Masters) in their subjects to help out students. It's only been used so far in two of our English classes (so it's typically requesting feedback on essay writing) but it would be interesting if they have tutors for other subjects such as computer science too. Having that quick feedback can certainly be helpful to a learner."	9/22/2015 13:17	818	6	
Student40	Student7	1	"Hi Ben, very interesting project! It sounds similar to what I kind of try and achieve in my PHP/MySQL course every time I teach it (essen[firstname]lly the same 3 goals you described at the beginning, but switched out for web development technologies). It's a tough road (at least for me) to assemble things in the right order for students to make all of those leaps towards buil[lastname]g their own applications. Your list of ini[firstname]l getting started resources is useful though (I'll hold onto some of those links for myself...I've wanted to experiment with iOS development myself). One additional question I would have is whether you expect your students to come to the material with or without a programming background? (In my class, the students have a mix of experiences, so it can be difficult at times since the students that don't have a programming background tend to slow the class down a lot...maybe in your case it won't be an issue if it'll be more self-paced, rather than taught in-person)."	9/22/2015 13:31	512		
Student40	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"Hi Kamran, I think another issue/question I would have regar[lastname]g this approach is wondering whether it works for all students? For example, I've been leaving the class I'm currently teaching fairly open (par[firstname]lly due to not being able to fully develop all of the content prior to the start of the semester) and have really been encouraging my students to ask questions and use Piazza and start discussions, etc. But instead I'm just getting *crickets* with very few actual questions getting posted so it seems like my students aren't being very active in trying to learn the material on their own and asking their own questions...instead it seems like they are either waiting for me to provide more structure and specific instruction. So, I'm just wondering if the learner centered approach would work in this situation too (how could I apply this for my class so my students are able to learn more actively)?"	9/22/2015 13:39	730		
Student40	Student71	1	"Hi [firstname], Interesting project...I would say the content piece is a big one (though your link to the Pinterest page is an interesting one). One thing I wish we had more of nowadays are videos sort of like the old 40s and 50s ones that were created and used in classrooms (I'm not sure if any of these are like the ones you were showed in the 70s or not): http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/28/12-vintage-instructional-films-worth-watching/ At the Federal or State it would probably be nice if a full set of ""social guidance"" films showing positive soft skills (and other skills) for students would be great to have as a standard library for schools to use (they could even create some basic tests on the topics and have the children show that they've actually learned the needed skills in some way). For myself, I would say the five soft skills you've listed I've acquired more and more after I started working full-time. Like anything, they get better the more practice you have (and currently, schools don't do as much to promote leadership, time management, problem solving at times...at least not directly. For example, math classes help teach problem solving, test taking might help teach time management, and sports help teach leadership, but I don't think there's any core curriculum that tries to teach all of these to all students, which is what I feel you're proposing, and I do see that there would be value in doing so).

Student43	Student38	1	"Holy cow! GPlag lost to a computer crash? Yet another example of the need for version control. I've seen a few of your papers/posts so far and it looks like you're making steady progress. For my feedback, I have a couple questions that you may or may not have thought about already. You're looking at academic plagiarism tools. Are these the same or are there others that are used ""professionally""? I'm thinking in the case of lawsuits regar[lastname]g intellectual property where one company may be claiming that another has copied their code. Do any of these tools, or do you foresee a future, for a common ""clearinghouse"" of code, to catch plagiarism across multiple classes or even the same class across multiple educational units (schools, MOOCs, etc)?"	9/22/2015 14:50	1175	7	
Student43	Student35	1	"I think you did a reasonable job of answering your personal question. One aspect I don't think you really touched but I think you should consider is how these metrics could be gamed (if they are known). For instance, if number of commits is a metric, I could easily increase the number of commits I submitted. Or if fixing bugs is a metric, I could introduce bugs that I would then resolve for credit (or trade on knowledge of bugs, a known issue with bug bounties). Lastly, if a abstract metric is ""amount"" of code written, it might be missed that one person implemented a small number of lines of code but of more ""value and/or efficiency"" than someone else who produced many lines of code with low value and/or efficiency. I noticed that your metric [firstname]ghts don't add up to 100%. I wasn't sure if that was intentional or overlooked."	9/22/2015 15:10	1896

A couple thoughts: - include options to define and select preferred roles for class projects, like SDP, which include roles like developer, tester, project manager etc. - include options not only where the submitter is describing his/her own traits but also can select desired traits for his/her team members (I expect some would be implied by my preferred roles suggestion)"	9/22/2015 16:07	13	7	Excellent thought Justin.

Student87	Student5	1	"Your analysis is very thorough. I really liked how you had a very narrow goal in mind and focused on how you and your group plans to fix it. Also, I think part of the reason MOOC's aren't as successful and don't have a high retention rate is because they don't offer anything past personal gratification. Most companies aren't going to accept a MOOC certificate in lieu of a degree. So I think Dr. Thrun's idea of a nanodegree is great and is a step in the right direction.

Student51	Student94	1	My first suggestion would be to consider how technology introduction is effected by a mixed class room. If you have three age groups your older two age groups will already be exposed to the technology from previous years but your have one third of your class that needs to be introduced. This produces an interesting dynamic that isn't always there in a traditional class room. I would also challenge you to think outside the box in terms of technology.

You addressed the prompt very well, emphasizing that differences between users wouldn't be a result of age or background but could vary based on their reason for learning the language. I think your approach would definitely favor those seeking fluency over functional understan[lastname]g. I was confused on one aspect of the project, however. I read your mini-proposal for some context and you mention that the user must pass in a source of Chinese text. In the personal question, however, you say you don't want to have to filter content based on age groups. Is your plugin going to actively look for content or is the user going to pass it in? Either would work although, from a user perspective, I wouldn't really like having to go hunt down my own article in Chinese to pass in. For your first iteration though, you might want to just have the user pass it in to avoid explo[lastname]g the scope. Also, you ended a paragraph mid-sentence so watch out for that going forward.

Student66	Misc3	2	"I wasn't sure whether your proposed project has to do with an intelligent tutoring tool for industries in which there is a skills gap or whether it is research on skills gaps in general so take this feedback with a grain of salt. I think you did a good job assessing two industries besides automation engineering in which a skills gap exists. I feel like the manufacturing industry is facing an existen[firstname]l crisis (not being a desirable job while still being necessary) although I do believe IT is a teachable skill in terms of internal classes within a company. I think you have touched on a key point in that the industries need to incentivize their workers to go after certain careers. People trying to encourage people to go into manufacturing or IT must find some way to encourage workers to join the industry or else the skills gap will remain ever-growing. I think that people can pick stuff up as they go (rather than learn it up-front in school) but they need to actually want to do it. You can apply that to either an intelligent tutoring tool or research in general. If you are making a tool, you need to find some way to incentivize users to actually take those courses or else they just won't use the tool. If you are doing research, the way in which industries can encourage workers to enter those industries en masse could be a topic in and of itself.

I would've liked to see you take a rough stab at how the AI agent would be implemented even if it wasn't yet your final design. One thing I am not clear on with the musical therapy is whether music is being used generally to put participants into a state of neuroplasticity or if different musics are applied at different times to elicit certain effects of neuroplasticity. If different musics are applied, an AI agent would be extremely useful to decide what music to play next.

Student66	Student64	1	"Great topic which will become increasingly more relevant in the near future.. I think that you're right in that some factors are out of your control. That said, if you can achieve small success, more success will become easier and easier. With more student engagement and better test scores will come more fun[lastname]g and more positive role models for students. That means that you must indeed work smarter, not harder. My question for you is how big of a scope are you targeting? For a given school or area, you might be able to ensure that your vision of the program is being met. However, how will you roll this program out to other areas? Many programs similar to the ones you reference try a franchising system but can suffer from poor quality as the number of franchises exceeds the view of the leadership. If you focus on a given region, you might have more success but risk limiting yourself in the long-term. I believe that your strategy is good. If you can find a way to (1) incorporate specific examples of how you plan to help children learn critical thinking and pursue STEM careers and (2) elaborate on a specific strategy for expan[lastname]g the program over time, your vision will be complete.

I would never say, gah Professor you are stupid for thinking/saying that, but at the same time I know in some countries even the idea of talking back, even if its not them being 'disrespectful' in our sense, can be disrespectful in their culture.

Student33	Student98	2	Excellent topic. I understand that you are approaching this from a big data sort of angle and using this data to identify deficiencies. I am taking it that this will be the ini[firstname]l design but I do believe that customized programs are needed in todays school system. One size fits all teaching approach is outdated.	9/23/2015 16:27	460		
Student33	Student1	1	I see your proposal. I don't think I am missing your mentor's question. Without that I can't really tell what was asked but I understand the concept of analyzing retention and I think you have some very valid viewpoints.	9/23/2015 16:38	195	4	I state what the personal question is in the second sentence of the paragraph.
Student33	Student81	2	I think that this is an excellent concept. I think you did a great job of answering the questions asked. I can see how MR/VR can be used to better prepare the armed forces and I also see how you are realistic about project expectations.	9/27/2015 8:13	12	6	Thanks
Student2	Student58	2	"Really nice write-up. You're demonstrating a really superior understan[lastname]g of your research space. I'm not educated enough to provide useful feedback in most areas of your project, but let me drill down where I can. In discussing the definition of a MOOC's success, you wrote: ""Even if the student finds the material worth pursuing, the MOOC may be a prelude to more traditional education."" Totally true. A year ago this time, I was teaching myself Java and studying CS theory with Coursera's Algorithms course. I didn't do any homework, I didn't ""complete"" the courses, but they were more beneficial than most of my undergraduate degree in Aeronautical Engineering. Because I took those MOOC's (among others, none of which I ""completed""), I realized enough interest to apply to the OMSCS and [lastname]e to a Software Engineering role at my current company. And now, less than a year after I started learning anything about CS, I'm beginning interviews with top tech companies. So yes -- carefully examine your definition of a MOOC's success. I suspect a great deal of information will be difficult for you to obtain (for instance, how would you ever find out about my outcome), but perhaps you can find a way. Looking forward to your fin[lastname]gs, [firstname]"	9/23/2015 19:00	792	6	Helpful commentary on how the problem is being framed
Student2	Student79	1	"Very good examination of material relevant to your question. I think the information you've found will be a boon in designing and developing your application. It also seems you have a good concept of your product. And, you have a realistic set of concrete goals for the semester. I'll quickly note that images may be crucial. I don't think a pull-up text and slog through it type approach would be effective for users. It'd be awesome -- even for adults -- to have short snippits (a sentence or two at a time, perhaps) accompanied by high quality illustrations. Not only does it increase engagement, but it provides subtle context clues for [lastname]slation. If you were able to effect that into a smooth and reactive user interface, that'd be awesome in and of itself. Looking forward to your end product!"	9/23/2015 20:09	511		
Student2	Student15	1	"Interesting proposal for your project. I think such a system would certainly prove useful. Do you plan to develop the content tagging engine as a part of a larger ITS? Or will you just produce the engine and provide an API that can be used by other ITS? One thing I'll say is that I don't fully understand the scope of your project. I'm sure your idea is much better than mine, but be sure to have a clearly defined scope for your work. Think about how it will be used, and what you can do as a creator to develop something that's useful in the long run."	9/23/2015 20:18	461		
Student2	Student28	1	"Excellent review! Well written and answered your question well. I suspect a great deal of actual, meaty data for your tool's success will take time to generate. You'd have immediate information the semester it's released (which you seem to realize, based on your observation related to social media posts), but the most interesting insights would be in the academic performance of your ini[firstname]l participants. I, too, am developing a tool for my project. Much like you, I'm not focused on creating something for the purpose of being popular or profitable. It sounds like you're well aware, but I wouldn't focus too much effort on your product's adoptability. Make something that's useful for people who want it. If it's good enough to provide an appreciable advantage, you'll have users."	9/23/2015 20:25	1001	7

Student67	Student65	2	"Hi [firstname], I thought you put a lot of thought in your idea. I think you have a good chance of fin[lastname]g interesting results if you test your tool in your class :) One thing, that made me wonder is how will you create the database of questions? will this come from you? from previously test questions? or other teachers? or will you google them? I think this is key in your tool since it could be demotivating or confusing if questions given are too difficult/easy. Also, is this tool going to be an app? a website? or something completely different? It might be worth exploring which of these options would be more engaging and helpful for your students. Maybe give one group of students one implementation of your idea while another group gets a different implementation. Overall, great job!"	9/23/2015 21:45	1526	7	
Student67	Student52	1	"Hi [firstname], Using some sort of tool to grab and decode the emotions of people while they are learning would be truly incredible! This way you can truly customize the learning experience in real time therefore allowing it to be more effective and engaging. I also agree that video-based emotional agents would give you a lot of more data to decode different types of emotion as opposed to the audio only approach. Overall, great job!"	9/23/2015 22:10	1270	6	
Student67	Student59	1	"Hi [firstname], I find the problem you are trying to tackle really interesting. As someone who has learned English, this would have definitely come in handy back in the days! I think the different classes you are using are good parameters to classify your text. Something you mentioned is that topic extraction would be difficult and that you ""will be focused on tuning and training existing topic models on relevant text sets (known as �corpora� in the NLP world)."" Does this mean you will allow your tool to ""learn"" first. If so, then your margin of error for classification should be minimize over time due to the fact that you can feed your tool enormous amounts of data and let it learn. This would be really neat! Overall, great job!"	9/23/2015 22:32	1005		
Student67	Student86	1	"Hi [firstname], I think your idea is great! I really wished my school had some sort of programming in my early days in middle school, it would have certainly speed up my understan[lastname]g of programming fundamentals. One thing I would suggest is explored what is the ""process"" for [lastname]es in the curriculum. What are the requirements? who approves it? how long does it take? and see if there has been attempts to implement [lastname]es that you described in your proposal from other people and see what they have learned from that process. I think this is key because maybe you can get this incorporated into a curriculum in your local school system. That would be really awesome! Overall, great job!"	9/23/2015 22:49	1010		
Student47	Student4	1	"While you did answer the questions, I would have liked to see more sources and definitive numbers to back up your answers. You referenced a studies in Q4 - so more detail about that would have been helpful. You also touched on seeing individual student's progress. What are some technology solutions that do this in the field now, and do you also then use technology to guide the student on areas they struggle with, or does the teacher fall back on more traditional teaching methods?"	9/23/2015 22:03	2300		
Student47	Student75	1	"Really interesting tool and you did a good job answering the question. You've clearly described why the tool is needed and what the tool should do. Where I'm curious is why you opted for a phased roll-out instead of just releasing it to all students in one go. I understand from what you wrote that you would prefer a pilot to see how it goes, but it sounds like this tool is very much needed by the entire OMSCS community. Additionally, if you roll it out to a small group of users, then the issue it is trying to solve (making sure resources are allocated appropriately) would not be solvable, right? Because there is still a large group of students outside of the system so a lot of data would be missing."	9/23/2015 22:46	711	5	"Pilot phase is just for temporary - may be for one semester only. To see the user load, report and if there is any new requirement based on the ini[firstname]l feedback. Anyway, I understand that we need to consider for all - not just for few pilot users. Thanks!"
Student47	Student51	1	"Fascinating stuff, and your personal experience with this really helped me to understand your area of research. Does VSM work better for particular age groups?

Student47	Student94	1	"Great job, very thorough and detailed answer. It sounds like there is a lot of movement in the area of both making technology accessible to those that need it and fun[lastname]g technology purchases in schools.

With that said, you've talked about the feasibility, but not what is a feasible timeline. 2 years? 5 years? 10 years?"	9/23/2015 23:08	435		
Student94	Student26	1	This is an interesting topic. I am wondering how you are able to grade webpages. Are you gra[lastname]g it for technical correctness or gra[lastname]g the webpage itself.

The rubric in our case will be specified in terms of technical requirements that can be tested, and possibly with some items that involve manual evaluation, e.g. ""ease of use / navigation / content (10 p. each)"""

Is the baxterbot you are referring to related to these, or does the name refer to your own concept? http://www.baxterbots.com/available-bots.html (Note: a reference would be useful in this case, even if it's a link. I didn't use any references in my personal question, either, but it will be important later.) Is soldering an advantage or a disadvantage? Soldering certainly adds another dimension, which might or might not be a positive part of the experience, especially since some learners get stuck on soldering. I think it would help to have a side-by-side chart of the robots you are comparing to. I see that the mBot is about $50 wholesale. What components does it include? Does the buyer get more robot for their buck? What is the focus of your project? Soldering and electronics, Or programming? These three are listed in the ini[firstname]l bullet points, but the end refers to electronics and soldering skills. How does this relate to your semester project? That is, what will you deliver this semester? I can imagine a document describing a kit that anyone can put together, along with a step by step tutorial.

Student80	Student71	1	"How would soft skills be integrated into a curriculum? Would it be taught as a part of other classes, such as English or History? I can imagine this, since literature provides examples of character, and history, of course, has figures to study. Would problem-solving be taught in the science class? Would it instead be provided as a separate class, in which case, how would it fit? Would other classes be shortened to make room in the schedule for these? It reminds me of ROTC, and mar[firstname]l arts training, where character development is a core concept. Indeed, a student doesn't last in the long term without character, because the material becomes insurmountable. Could that aspect be incorporated into a science class? Especially amongst middle schoolers, how would you create a setting that really challenges that, such that the need for character is evident. It's interesting to think about how this relates to my project in this class, since I am working on means of identifying freeloa[lastname]g in group projects. This is certainly a character oriented issue. Why do you think freeloa[lastname]g is such a frequent complaint in group work? Could soft skills classes address it? Could gaming be a means of teaching soft skills? Research has been done on the team coor[lastname]ation aspects of World of Warcraft. http://gac.sagepub.com/content/4/1/47 Even single player type games could create challenges for certain aspects of character development. How do you make it fun, though?"	9/24/2015 5:04	2072	7	"This feedback is quite helpful as it offers some ideas. For example, I do think soft skills (which I might also define as ""acceptable social behavior"") could focus on group participation. Using gaming could be another approach to teaching soft skills. I had assumed a separate class or as part of ""health"" classes but perhaps it could be infused into classes that a particular skill pertains to. I think it may be better to be mandatory and separate, so the message is sure to be received. But perhaps other mandatory classes that all students take anyway could be the vehicle."
Student80	Student82	1	"""An AES is considered successful if the assigned grade is close to what a human would assign"" So might an AES be considered a form of turing test?

I understood the individual sections, but I didn't get their connection. I like the inclusion of code snippets and output. It shows me you have something definable that you are working on. Nonetheless, jumping from this to full on gra[lastname]g seems like a challenge. I assume cosine distance is related to latent semantic analysis? Would you be looking at the angle between the student's submission and the model answer? As far as applicability, it seems like it might work well on the short answers we graded in computer networks. However, I imagine it could be difficult to get a corpus large enough for such a specialized domain (how much text is there on ARP vs MAC.

In terms of developing a ""hacking"" mindset, this is a direct representation of how some companies hire White Hat hackers (the good guys) to determine network weaknesses and prevent Black Hat hackers (the bad guys) from infiltrating.

Student41	Student97	1	"It sounds very much like you want to build an application-based approach to training IT professionals to become better security experts by getting them into an offensive, rather than defensive, mindset. I believe that shift in mindset is likely a very important component of your learning program and there will likely be some fun ways to implement a program like that. Ini[firstname]lly, I was thinking of the Stuxnet program (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet). It might be an entertaining framework to use the idea that a foreign country is threatening the home country of the learner (keeping these fictional would help prevent geopolitics from clou[lastname]g the learning) and the learner has been tasked with bringing down the country's servers. Sometimes learners need an ""emotional hook"" to help keep them engaged in the learning. Once that framework was established. you could build the lessons around that idea but allow the learner to ""discover"" the lessons as they chose their methods for attacking the foreign country's servers. For instance, if a learner went the route of malware perhaps the country would discover and disable it, so the learner would be forced to use (and learn about) DDOS attacks. As you can see in this research (http://files.[firstname].ed.gov/fulltext/ED330332.pdf), when a learner has an internal ""locus of control,"" the learning objectives are achieved at a higher level. Giving the learner a degree of control over how the training is delivered gives them a sense of ownership over their training. You were definitely thinking the same thing when you said that the passive reception of training wouldn't likely result in behavior [lastname]e or learning. I would bet that any subject you would teach from an infosec defensive standpoint could be re-engineered to force the learner to view the subject matter from an offensive standpoint. It will be interesting to see what subject matter you choose to include in this training."	9/24/2015 14:08	12	6	
Student41	Student77	1	"I wish that I would have had an opportunity to read your ""elevator pitch"" as I'm not sure that I thoroughly understand your proposed solution, but assuming that I know enough to be dangerous... The revision of your third driver seems like a move in a good direction. Specifically, I believe that the ""sense of place"" is concept for which there is currently a void when discussing MOOCS. Stay with me for a second while I go off the reservation. It's been a few years since I've been in a classroom setting for any period of time, but I recall many teachers/professors saying things like, ""As you'll recall, XXXXXX led to XXXXXXX and that's why ad[lastname]g XXXXXXX doesn't...."" In other words, teachers were [lastname]forcing formerly-taught concepts by ad[lastname]g another facet to concept. I think calling this ""Connectivism"" is appropriate. This was often an off-the-cuff analysis by the teacher. It likely wasn't in the lesson plan. I would guess that it's occasionally used by instructors who get the sense that the class isn't ""getting it"" and so they help students bridge the learning gap by putting it into the context of a previously understood concept. Even though a lot of teachers may use this strategy on an ad hoc basis, it's an adhesive that helps students connect disparate concepts or build on previously understood concepts. That's a tactic that I don't believe often makes it into MOOCs. If I'm understan[lastname]g you correctly, your proposal might help give a learner that sense of place that an instructor in a classroom setting often does without thinking, Related to the metrics component, I wonder if it wouldn't be advantageous to further classify the posts. With a poorly designed course, there may be a lot of posts seeking clarity regar[lastname]g the basic lesson. The quantity of posts doesn't mean that it's an effective MOOC. Rather, the opposite might be true. You may classify some of the posts as provi[lastname]g context (or a sense of place) for the rest of the course. Perhaps other posts could be classified as posts that extend the subject matter into a more advanced level of discussion. Of course, there will always be those posts that are simply seeking clarity, but that might be more of an indicator that the subject matter wasn't being clearly taught. There could even be a [firstname]ghted metric, by which a MOOC that generates a lot of discussion that's buil[lastname]g from and exten[lastname]g the subject matter is given a higher [firstname]ghting than posts which are merely seeking clarity around the lesson. Hopefully I haven't gone too far off the reservation here and some of this is valuable to you. I'm curious what you mean when you say ""direct-from-lesson question submission form"" because I'm proposing a solution by which asynchronous courses can have a ""I have a question""-style button that connects them with a SME.

Student41	Student3	1	"Well, it sounded like the answer to the question wasn't too difficult to arrive at, but there are a lot more variables at play. If I'm understan[lastname]g correctly, it's not so much the implementation of the internet access that E-Rate provides, but, rather, it's K-12 schools who don't understand the maintenance, administration, and (perhaps more important) best usages for the technology that E-Rate helps provide access to use. This gets me thinking... Is there a body of knowledge for best practices when implementing tech (and specifically internet access) at the K-12 level? In my research, I found a group (heretofore unknown to me) named ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) and they appear to have developed standards and tools related to technology deployment in educational settings. I particularly liked their classroom observation checklist (http://www.iste.org/docs/excel-files/icot.xlsm) as this might be a very helpful diagnostic for determining how effectively a school is using technology in their classrooms. I also wonder if the DOE has any standards or best practices available for schools. It seems that this is an issue that shouldn't just be foisted off on schools as they lack the resources to properly deploy and maintain best-of-breed solutions. I looked at the State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) website (http://www.setda.org/states/) and found that many states have technology plans, but when I started reviewing the plans, well, they were generally fairly vague. Does every state need a robust technology planning and support center for its schools? Probably. I get the sense that a lot of schools are just out of their depth and are vulnerable to trendy, not research-based, solutions. Good luck with your project.

As an example, it used to be that you would buy tax software and install it on your machine using a CD, now you can simply access the software online. It would be interesting to see how this can be applied to more strict and high-security environments. Have you looked at Docker: https://www.docker.com ? It's a containerization system built on top of Linux containers. The idea is that you can capture snapshots of different kinds of systems, which can then be reproduced as many times as possible. It's pretty nice because each ""container"" is isolated from the rest of the OS, and by default cannot be accessed unless you whitelist specific ports, etc. It might be something that can be helpful towards your work."	9/24/2015 15:51	616		
Student19	Student100	2	"This is a fantastic write up. The fact that you already have a POC is great. I can certainly tell about your confidence and understan[lastname]g of the problem because of your experience with the POC. I like that you are interacting with established tools like the W3C validator. I might be lacking some context, but from what I can understand you are narrowing Auger to only HTML/CSS based projects. It would be nice to see other integrations, like validating JavaScript through JSHint or ESLint, or something else. I'm very interested to see where you take your project from here."	9/24/2015 16:01	3330		
Student19	Student76	2	"Fantastic work on this very well structured writeup. I fell that you were able to accurately answer your mentor's questions and at the same time provide enough context so that someone like me (who hasn't read any of your previous assignments) is able to understand what you are researching about. This is a very interesting problem space, and I remember fin[lastname]g myself 'gaming the system' as well. It would be nice to experience this type of tool that is capable of increasing student engagement and overall learning. I'm interested to see how you continue to work your project."	9/24/2015 16:57	479		
Student19	Student63	1	"I'm also working on game based learning for my project and I found your writeup very interesting. I particularly liked how you used examples of successful educational games to derive shared characteristics. Games aim to be engaging and entertaining, and sometimes it can be difficult not to sacrifice educational content for entertainment. I'm looking forward to seeing the progress on your project."	9/24/2015 17:05	620

Student53	Student43	1	"This project is one of the coolest ones I've seen so far. Using Oculus Rift to teach barten[lastname]g using VR looks like the future. I think one of the ""buy in"" to get learners will be the novelty of this item. However after the novelty phase fades away, then following all this bullets from the research is important."	9/24/2015 21:30	1194	5	
Student53	Student35	2	"This is very well written and referenced. A few of the concerns I had while rea[lastname]g were addressed. Like for example in 2.4, I like how you open it up to other uses, in fact I think this tool being so software-oriented would be used for individual projects even more so than group projects. Once concern I would have with group projects is the importance of the subjective measurements in group projects (e.g. in one of my past classes I had a team project, the leader of the team was crucial to our success by facilitating meetings, tasks, documents, but did 0 lines of code). Another thing I wonder about is the metrics, I think using ""number of"" is a good starting point, but this should become more meaningful, specially to avoid the ""system being beaten"" by people familiar with it."	9/24/2015 21:50	7126		
Student53	Student24	1	"This definitely covers a need from OMSCS courses. I've been lucky with my teams so far, but I think the only mechanism that has been used is timezone. One more attribute you might want to add is native language, this goes a bit in line with the common interests one. In regards to the priority of attributes, maybe the recommendation can offer serveral scena[lastname], like ""considering this the biggest priorities this is your main match"", but ""considering this other attribute then these other 2 people"". Something along those lines, that way you allow some flexibility there."	9/24/2015 23:48	1153	6	Thanks [firstname]. Yes I agree as the tool grows we might want more functionality for determining successful team dynamics. With time the core algorithm for matching students can be improved substan[firstname]lly enough to provide decision making suggestions for instructors and ad[lastname]g some form of matrix for success rate will be cool.
Student16	Student63	0	"Very interesting paper. When the goal of the game is to measure knowledge, it's easy to map to a game where demonstration of the knowledge helps a player ""progress"". It feels like this pairing would be much more decoupled when teaching skill-based topics. I see a lot of these games used currently in elementary school, my kids have to answer a simple math questions in order to get points, jump a level, etc. I suspect that they would completely lose interest if we allowed them to play purely entertainment-based games, that the motivation would not hold up."	9/25/2015 9:36	256

Student16	Student100	1	"Overall interesting stuff, but I don't feel like it answers the really *interesting* question - which was "" How far do you think you can push the feedback that your system will give students for open-ended projects?"".

Student58	Student67	1	"The section about prestige seems to capture an important component of education. We often depend on the reputation of an education provider (be it a school, professional creden[firstname]ls or some other source) to determine the education's value. This can be a bit unfortunate since it slows or prevents the adoption of new education sources (and I think online education still suffers from this), but it also makes a lot of sense from the learner's perspective. It can take a significant time investment before a student can determine the quality of education they're receiving, if ever. Sometimes it can be very difficult to know what you aren't learning about a given topic that you should be. Leveraging Georgia Tech's reputation would a lot to add credibility to the education being provided and give the student the needed motivation. Nice work."	9/25/2015 9:28	840	6	
Student58	Student59	1	This is an interesting soun[lastname]g project. Once you make your database available an important component of your classifier may be user feedback. After being suggested rea[lastname]g material they could rate the appropriateness of the suggestion. You could build this into your model. This could be very helpful with age appropriateness since it's fairly subjective. If you have the information about registered users you could also build in a regional component. Given the large variations in cultural norms across the US (or among English as a second language learners) I could see an appropriate blacklist varying as well.	9/25/2015 9:53	1600		
Student58	Student65	1	"Very detailed and well thought out. If I'm understan[lastname]g correctly, the tool you're proposing is a smart practice problem database. After students demonstrate mastery of a topic through multiple correct answers the tool proceeds to the next topic. Do you have plans for user feedback that will highlight a lack of knowledge if the student is struggling? Hint systems can be trick because of the multiple ways a student can be approaching a problem and due to the problem of students gaming the system, but they can also provide real insights into problem areas for students."	9/25/2015 10:20	2171	7

Student26	Student21	1	"Hello [firstname], I like how you started by going back to your ini[firstname]l motivations to give the reader an idea of the background you are working from. Though since this is the very first time I am reviewing your work I would have wanted to have some brief summary about what your project idea is currently. Right now I had to work my way to getting the project idea as I was rea[lastname]g and how that project relates to the personal questions, it made be go back and forth with the personal question and your writing multiple times. As a rather general comment on the project itself, I find that OMSCS some resources are extremely successful (google+) and some are less so. I think a lot has to do with student perception of the usefulness of the resource, which again is tied to the content the resource provides. I think google+ checks all boxes because it's current and relevant, and with high quality content. I'm not sure how hard that is to automate if you have aggregated content across many sites as you discuss in your assignment, but nonetheless you should aim for similar qualities as I listed about google+ to make the tool successful. Personally I have recently come across some aggregate content solutions and some are not good at all, but one that I found and thought was very interesting is healthMap (http://www.healthmap.org/en/). I know it's a stretch and you have to approach is with some level of abstraction. I'm mentioning it though as an inspirational source, maybe it will give you ideas how to organize your content to make it appear relevant and current. Instead of map, you could have e.g. topics organized by course - just throwing some ideas out there. Also I would maybe have a way for users to up-vote some resources as a way to determine which items should get more visibility on your lan[lastname]g page. Overall I think this is a great idea, I think OMSCS could use some type of dashboard. There are many many pages to keep up with and more seem to appear regularly and it is probably very overwhelming to new students. My solution right now is just to keep a list of book[firstname]s in my browser and go through them individually for any updates. I would love to have some centralized resource."	9/25/2015 9:00	4204		
Student26	Student99	2	"Hello [firstname]. I very much appreciate how you organized your assignment. I think you did it with the reader in mind: the project recap and clear titles to indicate when you were answering each question were very useful and made your response much easier to read than some other papers I have reviewed that lacked such elements. Thank you again. Next, to comment on the content and project itself -- First, I think your project idea is excellent. This problem is universal and widely applicable if you are able to solve it effectively. I think the questions presented to you were exactly the same questions that came to my mind after I read your project description. I am very interested in your proposed solution to question 1. I have noticed as a human reader I can tell some people have a particular way of writing. For example if I read piazza with everyone flagged as anonymous I think I could spot some individuals or at least be in the right ballpark, but I would not know 100% who they are. I think it's interesting because often human is the superior AI agent, but even myself I'm not certain I could handle the task. It will be interesting to hear more about how you solve this problem e.g. detecting semantic similarity. Question 2 was particularly challenging. I would think of it as an edge case in your project domain. Although would be nice to be able to detect ghost writing in templates; just being able to detect it in free form essays is a major accomplishment so I would put most focus into that."	9/25/2015 10:10	1216	7

Your answers were clear and well-organized and easy to follow even though I had no previous knowledge of your project. I don't have all the specifics about your project plan, but for the communication part I was thinking about if I was working with a tutor, I would like to have a continuous flow of interaction. Say for example I sit an stare blankly at a wall for 2 minutes, I would expect my tutor to notice something is wrong. It's only an opinion but I think the more of these ""human responses"" you can bake into your solution, the better experience it will be for the user; and the less useful if the tutor appears non-observant or just responds with short answers and only after the student does something. I would expect two-way interaction for sure. Your discussion about behaviors was interesting and your list of references was impressive (!). It was interesting because it made me think of what type of learner I am personally. Can you be motivated by both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations or is it based on which one [firstname]ghs more? I don't know if I would design the system differently based on the two motivation groups; maybe use the same and evaluate the difference and have some way to test if there is much difference between the two motivation groups. And if so, what are those differences. How can you tell which group each person falls into? Also, definitely include some way to derive analytical data from the tutoring system. I have one last comment, a link to an article I read recently about machines detecting human emotions.

I think you articulated your thoughts clearly and it was easy for me to follow even without prior knowledge of your project. I also liked the image you included it helped to bring the idea across. You review of advisory services was interesting to read. For SSC you mentioned cost as weakness -- how much does it cost? I was waiting to see if you would mention Ellucian since I know we at GA Tech have that and my undergraduate university used it also. I'm not sure if you are planning to include this overview of existing advisory services in your final paper. If so, may I suggest you organize it into some type of ""feature chart"" to show easy comparison what each one offers if that information is still relevant to your own solution. You discussion about LMS and LTI interaction was interesting because you actually mentioned something that I hope to implement for my team project.

Student100	Student48	1	"Overall, very good background on DL in general. Though, I'm not convinced that you fully answered the questions. I'm not sure the iPad case was really an example of DL as much as a failed attempt to infuse technology into the physical classroom. I'm sure parts of it were ""distributed"" in nature (i.e., you could watch videos or do homework outside of the classroom), but I don't see it really as a DL failure, per se. And though you did a good job of identifying some of the key factors that might contribute to the success or failure of a particular course, I didn't see that you fully addressed the question of which subjects would work better in traditional vs. DL vs. hybrid. Regardless, a good effort overall, and I think you demonstrated a good grasp of the subject area."	9/25/2015 11:59	1407	6

Student100	Student25	1	"Overall I think you did well with your answers. Your topic hits home for me, as our labs are hampered significantly by the lack of a system for maintaining images. We use tools to lock down the workstations, but do little to effectively manage our images. In fact, while we have software to create and distribute images, most of our labs don't leverage the images and are instead chaotic, inconsistent, bare-metal installs of sometimes conflicting tools to meet the needs of countless professors. That said, in answering the questions I personally would have more concerns with maintaining security standards when there are huge number of separate VM's. Not so much with FERPA, but with keeping up with patches. In most institutions, when the machines have single, bare-metal images, they can use mature tools to insure software is kept up to date and in compliance with security standards. Here, where VM's may sit dormant and unused for months or even years (in between course offerings, presumably), then ensuring the discipline to update each VM is vital. Most issues with FERPA (or HIPAA or other personal data protection) are somewhat moot in your scenario as this data is generally stored centrally and locked down using standard tools and procedures. VM-based workstations likely affect this little beyond the poten[firstname]l of unpatched security holes (and even there, likely there's likely very little additional risk being introduced. I imagine also that there would be concerns with provi[lastname]g what amounts to remote access to local resources (i.e., RDP or similar over the public internet into a VM of a workstation image running on hardware physically resi[lastname]g inside the firewall). You would likely want to address any concerns related to this, as well."	9/25/2015 14:38	1098

Student52	Misc3	1	"Hi Mohamed, Great job on presenting the problem that you are focusing on by inclu[lastname]g many supporting references to build your case regar[lastname]g the skills gap that is present. Your paper was of more interest to me, in particular, because I am also pursuing the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems although in a different area. The idea of ITS�s is very exciting and seems like it has limitless poten[firstname]l to have a profound impact on how we as a society function and as workers execute our job duties. I think this idea is what started the percolation process in my mind to research ITS�s further. One of the other points that you made regar[lastname]g the effectiveness of ITS�s is how they can be used to complement the classroom experience and not necessarily replace it altogether, which is something I tend to agree with considering the research I�ve gone through so far as well. You made strong references to both the pharmaceutical and medical fields as a comparison to automation engineering. With that, I�m curious how exactly you are planning to pursue your research in this class; will it be primarily focused on automation engineering or will you also be inclu[lastname]g studies and information about the pharmaceutical and medical fields as well? My mind has always been a little OCD when it comes to automation and efficiencies in processes or systems. I say that because of how you are inclu[lastname]g automation engineering in your research. I think the exciting part about your paper is how you are essen[firstname]lly teaming two very productive ideologies (ITS�s and automation engineering) to expand a field that desperately needs more work, accor[lastname]g to your research so far. Effectively, I see automation engineering being a field that can be used in almost any field. Pair that with ITS�s and you can begin to educate a new generation of workers that will hopefully [lastname]sform their industry of interest. Great paper and I hope to hear more from your work!"	9/25/2015 20:29	197		
Student52	Student86	1	"Hi [firstname], I liked how you structured your paper with the time, effort required, technology and logistics, and teachers sections. This helped cleanly convey your research topic in respect to each of these areas. Your paper reminded me of a book that one of my colleagues published this year that could be of assistance to you. It�s a book on how to teach kids how to program from the parent�s perspective, although I�m sure many of the principles and concepts within the book could be just as effective in the classroom environment for the middle schooler audience that you are targeting. http://bryson[lastname].com/teach-your-kids-to-code/ I agree with your statement about not requiring students to setup their own IDE, as that could become a point of frustration if there are any issues with the setup, which is not uncommon. Perhaps, as you mentioned, some sort of free online-based tools would best serve the students to use for co[lastname]g. Option 2 reminded me of how I really started my career path towards IT. I was in high school in Washington State and Microsoft had partnered with some school districts to introduce more advanced-paced classes using Microsoft technologies like, at the time, Windows 2000 Professional and Server. The instructor of the class was sent to Microsoft training himself so he could better train the class, but the idea behind this model could have huge poten[firstname]l for the backers, like Microsoft in this case. I eventually started using and recommen[lastname]g Microsoft technologies because of this experience. From the logistics standpoint, I thought about the Florida Virtual Schools Q&A with Guest9 earlier this week and how they focus on delivering the content at the students pace. If you�re looking to introduce programming into the course load within a classroom environment, then that approach wouldn�t be very effective, but I wanted to mention it if you could benefit from that method where students could learn at their own pace and perhaps bounce questions off the teachers when they needed assistance. I look forward to hearing more about your research!"	9/25/2015 20:32	1655		
Student52	Student45	1	"Hi [firstname], Great thorough and detailed paper! My current research topic revolves around Intelligent Tutoring Systems, so I definitely agreed with your statement regar[lastname]g a feedback system is much better when it has a �human� element integrated. After rea[lastname]g your paper, it sounds like using an ITS could poten[firstname]lly benefit you in your goal of provi[lastname]g informative responses that the learner can better use to improve upon. Your paper focuses more on the user interface design and responses, so an ITS may not be necessary but I wanted to mention it anyway. Your examples about Advance OS and Software Architecture and Design helped illustrate the problem you�re looking to tackle. It improve the effectiveness of the exams and/or projects, it�s important that the students can clearly understand where improvements can be made or even read about parts that were already exceptional. I enjoyed the section you wrote about Peer Feedback. I�ve enjoyed using this feedback system as well and has really introduced some new aspects of a class that I have not experienced before. Usually when I think of a feedback system, I imagine an automated system or a teacher that will be provi[lastname]g feedback. Peer Feedback really [lastname]es that aspect by introducing other students as the responders for the feedback. I�ve read countless papers that have in turn provided me with new insight into fields of study that I was not aware of or sometimes their paper actually helped me with new ideas in my paper. You made mention of the timeliness of the responses and I�m sure that would help greatly to have feedback prior to submitting your next assignment. With that said, I apologize for the later response on your paper. ;-) Great work so far and I look forward to hearing more from your research later in the class!"	9/25/2015 21:00	1178	7	I am so glad to see that students agree with all the shortcomings of various tools we use and how there is still a lot of scope of improvement.
Student52	Student66	1	"Hi [firstname], Really interesting topic! I liked your ideas proposed in the paper, such as [lastname]sitioning from drag and drop method to entering syntax as students learn to type. That seems like a good cross-functional learning approach where you are effectively stacking learned skills for the learner. This has the poten[firstname]l to show them how their learned skills can be applied in other disciplines as well. I think your problem solving-based approach with robots would also make the learning fun and engaging. One of the points you focused on was making this gaming process a complement to traditional classroom learning and I agree with that approach. My topic of research revolves around Intelligent Tutoring Systems and the more I research this topic, the more I realize that we are nowhere near having the capability with intelligent systems to outright replace teachers in the classroom setting. By complementing the traditional learning model with ideas as you have proposed, I think that students are the ones that benefit most. Your paper reminded me of a book that one of my colleagues published this year relating to teaching children how to program. I�m not sure if you already have a strategy in place for what material to use with your project, but perhaps this could be used as a point of reference to decide what topics are better for young students that are beginning to learn programming. http://bryson[lastname].com/teach-your-kids-to-code/ Your paper looks really solid and I think you have a clear guide on how you plan to attack this problem, like collecting student data for parents and teachers. Great information and I look forward to not only rea[lastname]g more about this later in the class but also hearing how well this is implemented outside of the class. Good luck!"	9/25/2015 21:20	844	7	
Student42	Student46	1	"In my own research on intelligent tutoring systems and learning games, I came across some research that implied that many students have trouble retaining learning goals of educational games because they are more focused on the game goals than the learning goals. It seems as if dragon box may do this more effectively by making sure that the game and the skill are one and the same. It also seems as if the ST Math program might be experiencing measurable success with learning games. It would be interesting to see if this success is unique to math or just to particularly well-crafted games."	9/25/2015 20:46	12	6

Student25	Student35	1	"Hey Osmin, Thank you for contributing a very detailed and well thought out solution to the problem of measuring team members contribution on a software engineering project. As I read through your proposal of this type of tool, would it be possible to �game� the system by generating many �small� commits or comments? For example, for me as a team member I may write one line and commit the code. And do this repeatedly until the function I am writing is complete. Whereas another team member would write the entire function and commit once. Would this system take that into account or would it see me as doing more work on the project? Same could hold true for other contribution metric if the students knew how the system factors their contribution into the project. Also, some students in the project may be at a different programming level then other students in the group which may make their level of contribution smaller to the project but actually learned more from their team during the process. Should they be penalized for that? These sort of questions might come up later on. Really cool idea you are looking at and looking forward to seeing more!"	9/25/2015 20:51	19		
Student25	Student48	1	"Hey [firstname], Looks like you will be examining a lot implementations of distributed learning systems and looking at the outcomes and lessons learned. I�m really interested to see sort of the �best practices� approach to how these systems should be implemented especially at a K-12 level. Would it be beneficial to look at the three different levels of K-12 (Early Education, Middle School, and High School) and compare distance learning systems implementations?

As mentioned, a way to �inject� an agent into their system to capture the user�s adoption. Would users need to be aware that they are being their interaction with the system would be tracked �anonymously� or not anonymously?

Student25	Student43	1	"Hey [firstname], Awesome project man! I�m not too familiar with 3D engines nor do I have any barten[lastname]g skills besides cracking open a cold one :) But I hope I can give some useful feedback for your project. Would this immersive world that the user is engaged in depend on VR or could it be done with Augmented Reality technology? I�m wondering if there are advantages of choosing one over the other for training purposes. I was thinking that having an AR type system at the physical job location provides greater acceptance since the trainee is experiencing the training with virtual objects at a familiar location rather than a virtual location with virtual objects. One thing that comes to mind is technology like HaloLens and if it provides any advantages for training systems as such as you are describing. Might be worth looking into to have a section that compares the two and why you chose VR. I imagine the attributes you provided could be applied to both. Hope this helps and good luck!"	9/25/2015 23:32	30

Also, my impression is that the system would incorporate workarounds for any self-reported inaccuracies (e.g., for ""Leadership skills"", if everyone rates oneself as a 9+) by allowing the instructor to exclude that metric (or rank it lower). Is that correct?"	9/26/2015 7:44	1887	7	Thanks [firstname].Greatly appreciate your feedback. As to your question: Could there be a way to integrate 3rd party services into the application? The poten[firstname]l is there to integrate 3rd party services. I think the current scope of project will not cover this for ini[firstname]l implementation. However this is a great suggestion and I will definitely take this into consideration while designing the bussiness logic and UI interface. About the last part you are correct.

It's me, [firstname] for NJ, finally we get to share some work together, albeit only a Peer Feedback :-D You have presented a fantastic write-up, the only item that was missing was the actual question you were asked and answered. But I have no doubt that you've answered the question as everything presented has been well thought out. The only challenge that came to mind while rea[lastname]g your proposal is how to recognized those students that may view the Udacity videos offline. As I'm sure you're aware, or may have taken advantage of yourself, we can download the videos for offline viewing. Hence, there's a poten[firstname]l for gaps with respect towards assessing the metrics behind video viewing behaviors. For these instances, I've always been curious if the students who regularly view the lectures offline just go to Udacity to complete only the quizzes? If so, this might be one identifying method towards categorizing this type of student.

[Side note: you missed the reference -- I only noticed because I'd like to read that paper too ;-)]. I have a suggestion if you have enough time, of course, perhaps you can offer the opportunity for the ""student"" to define their avatar. This idea may offer some psychological advantages for the student such as they created their character and can choose to be whomever they'd like to be. In terms of creating the avatar, I am thinking of a color wheel or color-based slider where they can color their skin, hair, eyes. Maybe choose their hair styles and clothes, all optional of course. But I believe that having the student create their avatar is a great way for the begin to engage in your education tool. They start off by being in control of who they are or would like to be in the social skills setting to be learned. I wish you the best of luck. Most sincerely, Student32"	9/25/2015 23:02	1363

Student30	Student39	1	"Friday, September 25, 2015 Hi [firstname]y, I loved your response to your personal question. What I like more is the focus on labs � which I have some experience with and agree with you that traditionally these are typically treated as a kind of step-child or afterthought � which is of course tragic because of all the poten[firstname]l benefits labs can provide. If I can add by way of feedback that through the years I have heard many students complain that (1) labs are time consuming and suck, (2) they are taught by TAs or others who seem disinterested in teaching, and (3) that they struggle to complete units but in the end learn little. Professors complain that (1) labs are generally cookbook and students rush to �fill in the blank� by rote at the last minute, (2) little actual teaching/learning occurs that is useful and (3) that they are time consuming to administer and grade. Not much of a ringing endorsement. On the other hand, my sister, an engineering professor, tells the story of a thermodynamics lab where students worked with an AC machine made by [lastname] which was a training device that allowed the professor to flip a switch an simulate various �faults� � and student had to solve the problem of determining, based on the data, the type of error and solution. She also has adopted teaching methods in a flipped classroom approach where students work problems and receive immediate feedback from apps that enhance the general classroom experience where students as you say do not have to waste time waiting on the teacher, and can learn at their own pace. These are kinds of efficiencies, or enhancements if you will, that seem to be on the right track in terms of using technology appropriately to enhance teaching/learning at all levels. More specifically, my $0.02 is that one approach to developing specific labs might best be to approach these like Kahn academy, where you select specific units of instruction � a lab for elementary students that demonstrates in an interesting way observation, measurement, and compiling of data to produce an outcome; a lab for high school students that demonstrates qualitatively the principle of separation of materials through chromatography techniques using simple filter paper; a lab for college students that uses lasers to show diffusion across an interface (one I did as an undergraduate that was beautiful, elegant and used advanced quantitative and theoretical techniques) � and to build these all as elegant self-contained units that can be packaged and delivered not only as you say on mobile devices, but with meaningful scripts and testing � I can see these as kinds of virtual machines for generating scena[lastname] and data with links to ancillary materials and a guided approach toward exploring the subject � a kind of 21st century lab manual that is not only multi-media, but has workflow and possibly intelligence � and that that this could be turned into an entire learning lab platform. One cautionary comment � we all understand the power and poten[firstname]l of these systems � but also understand that they can just as often introduce distractions and unnecessary overhead and clutter to the learning experience � and that one important key performance indicator (KPI) as it were, is how well the app does the job efficiently while minimizing clutter and distractions. The best technology,, outside of the virtual realm, is often a paper and pencil � so we all need to keep in mind if the introduction of these tools actually facilitates learning, and how. And that is the consideration and measurement of these that is a large, often overlooked component of the process of designing and implementing and testing these � perhaps one of the best labs is to have students actively engaged in designing low and high tech approaches and comparing them for outcomes. Not to get on my soap box � hope this is useful feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions/comments. I like btw your references � I wish I could collect all the references that each student has collected across all their papers for review � it would be very useful and most enlightening, I think.

Student30	Student9	2	"Hi [firstname], Very nice write-up � you demonstrate mastery of your subject area and I would score this as a 10 not only in achieving that rubric but in terms of your own framework, you �demonstrated mastery of the game.� I like your approach of framing a working definition of games in the context of learning tools, and your detailed discussion of Sim City in terms of Bogost�s analysis and Bloom�s Revised Taxonomy. I agree that a key point of understan[lastname]g the utility and pedagogy of Sim City is that success requires the player/student to create a theory or model of the underlying system, test this and adopt strategies and tactics accor[lastname]gly. In plain words, the player is forced to observe outcomes and create a kind of theory or mental map of what is going on � make connections based on data/observations, and through trial and error figure out what works. It is important to note that the player can adopt various strategies to achieve success � some more top/down and others more bottom/up, perhaps. And this begs the question of engaging the player � keeping them interested with appropriate clues and feedback. What I would add and by way of feedback, one model that comes to mind is the case study approach used by the Harvard Business School. I have been working with HBR case studies in the context of training MBAs for years, and the format of most is the same � the subject is introduced various players discussing a specific challenge � with everyone confirming to type � the accountants take an accounting view of the issue, the finance guy sees the issue through a financial lens, exclu[lastname]g all other factors, the operations guy only looks at direct impacts on his world, etc. And the student must examine the input data, form a hypothesis/solution and defend her position. To your point, these cases are designed to promote critical thinking and analysis, and ultimate to synthesize various data and perspectives into a single crystal clear point. They are designed to lead the student to understand the �one thing� that the exercise is designed to teach. To put it another way, I agree that clear definition of learning objectives is a key, if not the key consideration in designing an effective learning module or learning tool, inclu[lastname]g and especially perhaps the use of simulations as a form of the case study model. Or, perhaps you envision a series of training exercises that are not geared to teach the one thing, but in a more open sense give perspective or inspire creativity. These too are specific learning goals that should be defined, creating in effect a kind of roadmap inclu[lastname]g model, outcomes, measurement and considerations of the type of student and what approach is proven (or could be demonstrated) to work best. I agree with your observation that the strength of games is poten[firstname]lly the opposite of the classroom � they are interactive, provide immediate feedback and have the poten[firstname]l to promote deep learning. I would add that there is a kind of disclosure/[lastname]sparency aspect to this kind of training, where students have a clear idea up front of what they are signing up for and what they are paying their money, with clearly stated outcomes and goals. Not to get on my soap box � hope this is useful feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions/comments. I like btw your references � I wish I could collect all the references that each student has collected across all their papers for review � it would be very useful and most enlightening, I think.

Student30	Student101	2	"Hi [firstname], I enjoyed your write-up. I agree with your general premise that teaching/enabling teachers to use available technology better is a key component to improving education today. I would add by way of real-world feedback that although there are clearly a variety of factors impacting the adoption and training of teachers on new and better tools, here are some of the stories I am hearing: 1. Many teachers operate in a kind of overload environment where they are asked to teach students, prepare reports, interface with administrators and parents, prepare lesson plans, grade course materials, etc. Consequently, they are understandably reticent to embrace new technologies unless they see a clear and immediate benefit, and care should be taken in forcing teachers to adopt certain systems and in meeting specific requirements. 2. One common complaint that I hear from teachers is that they already have to work with, say three separate systems of classroom management, student interaction and administrative documentation, and that as a rule these systems do not talk to each other, essen[firstname]lly creating 3x administrative overhead (read �paperwork�) � where they have to re-enter lesson plans or lesson modules in triplicate to three systems � my view is this is clearly a bad set of systems that work against quality time between students and teachers, and on net inhibit learning rather than facilitate it. 3. Another common complaint I hear from teachers is that they face a lot of turnover in these systems � having to use and undergo training on 3 classroom management systems in 4 years, for example � is alarmingly common. 4. Many school systems as you point out lack resources for adequate training and tech support, and this causes problems with rollout and maintenance. 5. Not to mention measuring outcomes and having some set of clear objectives to determine if the project is successful. 6. There is also the issue of some teachers using technology as �electronic pacifiers.� 7. And that technology is well known for creating barriers, distractions and �clutter� that gets in the way of learning. 8. And that some teachers, for example AP History teachers, rightfully point out that the College Board AP History exam is pencil and paper and that students are better served to practice essays in a classroom without the aid of word processors with spell check, for example. 9. I love the story one public high school teacher from Texas has told me that he walks down the halls of his school, where all students are issued iPads � and that many are watching Netflix � and that his favorite educational �technology� is that he installed a mirror in the back of his classroom that enables him to stand at the front of the classroom and see at a g[firstname] what his students are looking at on their tablets. Having said all this, I am reminded of an observation an old psychology professor once told me �that the goal in clinical psychology is not to make the individual a perfectly great functioning person, but simply to improve their quality of life and coping skills from a lower level to a higher one. So, per your heuristic approach, training designed to generate �quick wins� in improving teacher master and confidence with digital tools is a genuinely significant goal that presumably will produce important ROI for our educational institutions. And that administrators might have the foresight to build programs that not only provide ongoing training, but training that is flexible and designed for immediate, practical results, as you have suggested, and that these be measured to better assess what is working and what is not. And that finally we do more of what is working and less of what is not, and that these results be widely shared across schools and with all stakeholders in these spaces, as you call them. Not to get on my soap box � hope this is useful feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions/comments. I like btw your references � I wish I could collect all the references that each student has collected across all their papers for review � it would be very useful and most enlightening, I think.

Student30	Student6	2	"Hi [firstname], Nice write-up. I like the idea of virtual digital simulations used both in traditional education institutions and in industry, and your emphasis on the point that companies need to provide training that has an audit component to demonstrate compliance in a regulatory environment � and this both mitigates risk and can be argued demonstrates an implicit ROI for the company. Regardless, good training systems hold the poten[firstname]l to produce good consultants � and among other things companies can � and do � charge more for consultants and technicians with higher levels of certification and competence. This applies not only to Medical Linear Accelerators but all sorts of DMEs and technologies of all sorts. A story, if I may. I have a friend who recently graduated from KSU with a CS degree with a passion for Linux OS and Cloud computing. He was recommended to Red Hat (RH) by the founder of the local Open Stack group, who works for Linux. After being recommended and his resume (rather thin) passing a first round, he was advanced to the next level and took and online test which consisted of presentation of a series of tasks and questions where he was required to provide responses in the form of code aimed at assessing his skills at Linux network administration. He passed this level and went for a job interview and was offered a position as a cloud consultant at as starting salary of $99K. After an onboar[lastname]g event last week that included traditional HR activities (401K, healthcare, etc.) presented in a traditional way with PowerPoint and paper forms, he received some technical training and then spend his first week on the job studying from home to pass the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) and later Engineer (RHCSE). A week�s worth of training consisting for �read this, watch this� with some short tasks and a final qualifying exam consisting of links to a VM entering administrative commands and codes to accomplish specific tasks � the gra[lastname]g of these is currently outsourced to India and has a one-week turn-around. My point is to agree with you that digital simulations of all sorts can be integrated with existing authoring tools and that one key ingredient to their success clearly is the ease of integration and short-learning curves � and that training on producing content is a very different kettle of fish than being an end-user of that content. One last significant note is my friend�s observation that the quality and level of the RHCSA dwarfs any training he received as an undergraduate at KSU. Your ideas re: pre-established error conditions and use of Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) methodologies is apt, inclu[lastname]g monitoring of student submissions and the incorporation of larger functionalities into a system, such as email reminders and scheduling. I would add that identification of clear learning objectives, and the [lastname]sparent publishing of these and presentation of standards to students is a must, and that of course provi[lastname]g a mechanism for assessment of what is working and what is not is a key component that should of course not be overlooked. Just my $0.02. Not to get on my soap box � hope this is useful feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.

So giving kids a taste of programming language syntax along with what each of the syntax do (with the help of robot) will be very helpful.

Student37	Student91	2	I see real value in what you are trying to do: online learning has long settled with the assumption that someone watching a video / completing a url has mastered the topic within... if you can store their actions in RELATIVE frames...are they looping the same video over and over? Are they constantly jumping back to 0:43 because they cant understand something.... I think you'll have a really profound way to capture student learning blockages.	9/26/2015 1:01	212	7	"I like this feedback. [firstname] points some ideas for what my student learning knowledge representation may be useful. I am actually really thinking to record all useful information about the student learning process since my first implementation, in a well organized way; inclu[lastname]g the complete sequence of actions, using IDs references and related info like time spend, number of times accessed, and any other info available. There is no reason why don't record any available information, actually. So, I will put special attention on this, also because, as a personal question it was, my understan[lastname]g is that it is of the most relevant interest and concern for my mentor."
Student37	Student68	2	"Honestly the biggest issue with most testing is that most of it relies on memory. College prep tends to boil down to teaching your students exactly what to say and do to be qualified to go to school, and not teaching them to solve complex problems on their own, or even use the tools available in the world today to solve such problems. NYC's new stance on mandatory comp sci education in high school is a HUGE HUGE step forward, but I think we'll be in the dark ages till we're allowed to look things up during assessments, thus forcing assessment writers to eliminate trivial stuff and focus on actual application of knowledge."	9/26/2015 1:05	197		
Student37	Student70	1	"I think part of the problem with ""feedback"" based search results is that user-generated content, while nifty and free and useful, is never as good as a domain expert coming in and assessing the content and saying ""huh this article was actually really good for XYZ topic"".

Student13	Student18	1	"Hi Hassan! I really enjoyed rea[lastname]g your personal reflection. You have done a wonderful job and having a mentor like Ken is definitely something to cherish. In your personal question, you were tasked with talking about cross-cultural education & barriers. In terms of questions, I am curious on a few things. You noted that ther are two dominant frameworks - xMOOC and cMOOC. Where are these coming from? you mentioned that xMOOC is the most popular form. Did you happen to have a source? Just wanting to get your head thinking on things there as you want to make sure you provide strong defence to your arguments if you take them to a journal article. That was one of the challenges that I had, is that I wasn't sure completely which parts of the personal reflection were your own arguments, and which were supported by research. In terms of cultural perceptions, you noted this statement: ""It has been identified that important cultural differences exist in Western and Eastern education systems."" Did you have a resource where you took this from? How significant are these differences and why do they exist? And, are these [lastname]ing? I loved that you used Hofstede's framework. Did you have a specific resource that you referenced? Also, in terms of the grouping of things into dimensions - PD, IC, and UA, are these your own conceptions or observations or ones backed up by research. One thing that can be helpful in research is to make sure you state to others where you are making a contribution. Again, this was an area where I wanted more since I loved so much of what you had. The other questions center around the how. How important are these issues? For example, you wrote (regar[lastname]g uncertainty avoidance): ""This factor should be kept in mind while designing course structures."" Do you have evidence to support this? You mention about East vs West differences and I don't disagree. That said, I wonder how much of that is supported by research. Also, the same was true in my mind for each of the following. Language, for example is a factor in learning. But what does it effect? You note that non-English students report that language barriers are their biggest concern. Wouldn't you imagine that this concern is the same if say you were going to Russia to study and everyone spoke Russian & you didn't. Language would be a barrier but be the real factor that impacts how successful a pedagogical approach is. Again, just food for thought! All in all, a great piece of work. My biggest suggestion here - even if it is a personal opinion, is cite more. For example, on your page two, you continue to talk about things like the ""cultural dimension of learning framework"" and other frameworks but didn't have any direct quotes or citations. I would recommend doing that. If you can do that, and laser in on how you want to study what you want to study, you will be in the drivers seat!"	9/26/2015 2:03	819		
Student13	Student95	1	"Hi [firstname]! Thanks so much for sharing your work. I look forward to seeing how your project goes and encourage you to reach out if you want more support (Nate [lastname]; nj[lastname]@sfu.ca). As I was rea[lastname]g through your responses, I had a few questions pop into my mind that I wanted to ask about. Firstly, your goal is to create low cost, customizable, easy-to-build robot kits that will be used in class. I have actually taught a class using robots before - so I love the content. Firstly, you talk about the learning objectives. I wonder, are any of those learning objectives grounded in any literature? Is there any order to these or all each of these objectives equally attainable. For example, do you need to know the basics of electronics before learing to solder? And, how are these types of objectives measured? Have you considered this or looked at various poten[firstname]l sources to support these? I would definitely encourage you to check out the literature if you can and be sure to reference all that you find in your finished copy. Next, you talk about the advantages and disadvantages of several systems. You talk about Lego NXT & some others. The first question that I have in my head is - do these pros and cons relate to learning objectives, or just the systems as a whole? As I read, you talk about Lego NXT as being a great robotics starter kit. You do mention that kids ""often outgrow the programming"" for NXT ... why is that? Is there something you can do to make these systems more intelligent and less rule based? I have seen a ton of discussion out there and of course am curious. Would encourage you to review anything there. Also, again, tying advantages back to learning objectives might help me see things that much clearer in terms of what you choose & why. I liked your conversation on Vex. As you come to the end, you talk about BaxterBot, your proposed choice. You mention that this would be programmed in C, which is similar to other robots. You also list a host of advantages. That said, what would have helped me is a more concrete direct comparison of your proposed bot versus the other bots. I wonder if a table would have helped. My challenge is that, I left the end unsure of how your package was better. You note that the other robots are expensive. That said, if the expense necessary to meet the learning objectives? And what learning objectives does BaxterBot meet and why? I would think that argument would be most compelling of all - since if you can meet more objectives or the same at a much lower cost, there would be little reason for current users to avoid adopting! Thanks again for a great read & good luck with your project!"	9/26/2015 2:17	2407		
Student13	Student8	1	"Hi Chris! I was very excited to read your paper. If you need anything from me support wise as you work through things please don't hesitate to reach out (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca; Nate [lastname]). In your personal reflection, you were asked to discuss how you would motivate students to engage authentically. As you note, you are creating an HTML5 game based on social stories. You jumped into talking about games for teaching students with Autism. That said, I wanted to back up. There is a ton of literature that I am aware of on games & motivation, flow states, etc. Have you reviewed this to help you better understand what it is that might help. Then, comparing those requirements with the ones you add, remove, or augment for autistic students would seem to be poten[firstname]l fruitful. On page 1, you talk about why using a video game is a good idea for teaching students with autism. You cited Mitchel, Parsons & Leonard. I am curious if you reviewed other sources. I assume the answer is yes, but if it is not, would absolutely encourage you to widen your scope to really add some punch to your lit review. I am curious why Mitchell at all concpude that students with autism show more enthusiam and learning gains. To that end, how did they actually measure this? Was this a controlled study with a controlled experimental design? These are all things to consider since you would poten[firstname]lly need to have a testing methdology to review how or why your game was successful. I was eager to get that piece. You do note some observations, such as the fact that students will not have to worry about getting upset. Social anxiety. In this section I had a harder time parsing between what we your own thought and literature - which is why I focused there. Do you have sources to support your argument that "" Social anxiety is a big problem for students with autism so helping those students calm their anxiety is a must."" That might seem silly, since I have worked and coached autistic students. That said, in the context of the research paper be sure to rigorously support this with citations to remove any openings for people to critique. I like that you cite Mineo et al. to talk about the issue of a confined viewing space. That said, again am curious. What is it about the space that improves focus? Is it just the space? I am asking since this might impact the medium of delivery that you use for a game. I mean, if you need a very confined viewing space, would you ever do something on a desktop? How does mobile based gaming fit? Is that a good or useful fit? In your next section you talk about fun. I love the talk about Math Blaster and remember it well. That said, I am curious. Is there any literature that talks about comparing Math Blaster to non-gaming environments? You mention also that you would create a game where students can ""positively act out the social skills from the story"". How would you encourage this outside of the game and what will the game medium be? When you talked about platforming and Mario I didn't think about social interaction. Thus, the questions. You then talk about collecting things. How would you ensure that you don't play too much into the OCD / hoar[lastname]g behaviors that you describe as being seen? You talk about giving the students ""bounds"". What would this look like? What are useful boundaries for a collection? Number of elements? Number of elements added or removed? Overall, I loved your start and am anxious to see where you take the project! The next steps for me are all about specificity. Being more specific with what you need to do requirements wise and how you want to do it will really help I believe. Keep up the great work & good luck!"	9/26/2015 2:58	1795		
Student13	Student74	1	"Hi [firstname]! I loved rea[lastname]g your personal question. Do keep me posted if you need help, as I am happy to support you (nj[lastname]@sfu.ca; Nate [lastname]). In your project you are proposing creating an iPad app that leverages video modelling. Firstly, you talk about customizing the video for the student. In this, you make the statement: "" It is of crucial importance to the process that the child attends to the video, and in order to do so, the video needs to be tailored to the particular student."" As I read this, I was a little confused around your usage of the word ""attends"". Are you referring to attachment. I understand it in the context of Bandura's quote. I was also unsure of the link between a child ""atten[lastname]g"" to a video and the videos need to be tailored or personalized. Did Bandura support this? Again, just raw questions coming to me as I read. That said, it makes general sense to me when you speak about modelling having this kind of interaction vs something pre-recorded. That said, I wonder again how you do it on mass (or if that is really even your audience). Asking since you noted that: ""it is important for the educators to record their own videos having in mind the particular student or students to be targeted."" How many students types are there out there & does that matter? Finally, you also make the comment that: ""the familiarity of the environment in the video does not limit the learned behavior to said environment."" Is this fully supported today? I mean, in medical training environments you often want to simulate the environment to aid in recall. Is there literature out there or test data to support this approach? In the next section you talk about evidence-based work. You define when a practice is evidenced based and provide a great reference. You do note that this exploration is not in the current scope. That said, you make a comment that: ""In order for video modeling to be as effective as it has proven to be in the research that confirmed it as evidence-based, it needs to follow the definitions and implementation of the practice as closely as possible to the rules established during its research."" How will you do this in your project? The final piece is prompting and recor[lastname]g reactions. You talk about recor[lastname]g a baseline behavior. How will you do this successfully? You note that you want to personalize the app. Thus, there is going to be a lot of work tha tneeds to be done to get things ready for release. I am just curious how this will play out. Also, you make a few statements, inclu[lastname]g: ""Too much focus on a tool to record the session could diminish the effectiveness of it."". You also note that prompting is tricky. Do you have a strategy to approach things there? Overall, this is excellent work and I look forward to seeing how it develops. If you need anything at all from me don't hesitate to ask!"	9/26/2015 3:28	861		
Student79	Student65	2	I like that you are applying this to an actual problem you see in class.

Student79	Student67	0	"You did a good job presenting the research on motivational theory. But I'm a bit confused the specific app usage. Perhaps this is covered in other assignments, but it would be useful to have at least as an appendix. I'm mostly concerned that an app devoted to keeping students motivated will have a manufactured feeling. As you explain, value is a big part of motivation and this is most important by provi[lastname]g relevant engaging content. While you attempt to address this with allowing the user to choose their own content, I'm afraid getting enough good content to provide this will be difficult. Perhaps a good strategy would be to select a specific area of learning and flush out the details of how this would work. Instead of success story videos, I think demonstrating interesting applications of the knowledge to be learned would be more genuinely motivational."	9/26/2015 9:51	1137		
Student79	Student96	0	"I'm having a hard time relating this directly to ed-tech. It also feels very much to me more a collection of brain-storming ideas instead of a cohesive plan to improve the knowledge and skill of you customers. And what concerns me the most is what distinguishes this from just putting up some standard forums that users can contribute to. I would suggest focusing on a specific plan and distinguish how this will advance the field of ed-tech. Note: ""stitch and bitch"" works because ""bitch"" is a verb. ""stitch and bitches"" sounds derogatory. stitch-and-bitch's or ""stitch and bitch""s would be better in my opinion (or just ""stitch and bitch"" without the plural)."	9/26/2015 10:10	3928	5

Student77	Student97	1	"I think you tackled your coach's questions pretty well. One thing that I would be interested in seeing when you dive into your project even further is why are you buil[lastname]g a separate tool to teach this subject? Do you believe that the current tools available for online learning (like Udacity + Georgia Tech's OMSCS, for example) are not able to support this topic? Why is this topic so different from KBAI or CN or any of the other CS subjects that are effectively administered through a MOOC-style classroom?"	9/26/2015 10:45	123

It would be interesting, also, to see if you're able to integrate with existing dev tools, like Jira, Asana or Github, which typically do track a lot of what developers do day-to-day.

Student11	Student28	0	"I think the main metric to look at will be returning users. You could compare the returning users metric (possibly tied to registrar records to eliminate folks who have graduated or [lastname]sferred from muddying the numbers) to the publicized GaTech student attrition rate. It's a lot of correlation, but maybe some conclusions can be drawn from it with more research. I think one way to help retain users is to send a reminders before registration periods with suggestions on what courses to take, or to update their profile for new recommendations."	9/26/2015 10:46	13053	6	
Student11	Student18	1	"Nice work. I never really thought of cultural differences in learning. I'm not exactly sure what the proposed solution is though � I assume you talked about it in a prior assignment. Is this something that will be applied regionally? Or on a per student basis? I think if the course is somehow able to be customized to a student, that should eventually encapsulate regional differences in learning the student may have."	9/26/2015 10:46	14083

Student95	Student17	1	"I teach 6th and 7th grade robotics. I use khanacademy to teach both Javascript and lego robots. Khanacademy has a very good lms system that lets mee keep track of my students and how they have progressed through their lessons. At our school, we also use on-campus, which I guess is blackbaud. Both of these systems are very good. How will yours be different? One of the biggest problems with these LMS systems is their interoperablity with the schools internal gra[lastname]g/student database. It would be good if there were a standard way to move data around between systems (think xml) so I could automagically have khanacademy or oncampus data go in and out of our existing database. Good luck with your project."	9/26/2015 11:51	648		
Student9	Student20	1	"I think a lot of people (myself included) are interested in VR applications. I've done a lot of work with cardboard, and I think the biggest unsolved question is ""what about this is educational"". Avatars or simply creating a VR experience isn't inherently educational, or rather, not more so than other media - I'm wondering if you can narrow your focus to experiment with experiences that literally cannot exist in another medium. I'm thinking back to one of the early VR game prototypes where one player diffused a bomb, while the other was given instructions - part of the experience was created through asymmetric experiences and player communication. Is there a way you can sidestep expensive asset creation, and skip to experimenting on a lesson itself?"	9/26/2015 11:32	306		
Student9	Student101	1	"I like the underlying logic here. There is a lot of technology already available, and maybe the biggest problem is encouraging it's use, or continuing the development of something that already exists. It seems like you might want to find a group of tools you think are interesting, and maybe find some teachers and see why they haven't used those tools - and perhaps try to either make the connection, or offer suggestions for improvement. This is definitely a nuts & bolts type project, but I like it because it has the poten[firstname]l to have a big impact on a small scale, rather than a small impact on a big scale."	9/26/2015 11:37	256	7	
Student9	Student6	1	"Interesting - I'm not totally familiar with the project, so it's hard for me to offer much in the way of feedback. Still - I'm wondering how you will assess that a simulation is more effective than a powerpoint - since it seems traditional assessment is very important to the industry.

Have you looked at Slack (https://slack.com)? They have a free to use business model, with premium options, like what you discussed. Slack is not a learning management system (it is a messaging application for teams), but it has a lot of options for interactions (https://slack.com/integrations) like you proposed for your product."	9/26/2015 11:45	938

Student5	Student61	1	"You have done great research in ACM and IEEE. I also noticed the difference when doing studies rea[lastname]g papers from those organizations. You've asked great questions in the conclusion. I agree that people with programming backgrounds in one language don't necessarily need to learn the new language, but more so the format/syntax, the IDEs, and 'programming environment'."	9/26/2015 15:20	267	6	"I almost want to do a survey and analyze data on what people think they know vs. what that actually know. It seem like some of my peers accept a question as an answer and others want a direct answer. It is really interesting that another of my peers have noticed the difference in academic ""skew"". I just submitted my first draft and I want to keep the scope narrow but I am starting to feel that addressing learning a programming language outside of IDE/OS/environment is not appropriate."
Student86	Student90	1	"Yes, very good analysis one the personal question and very thoughtful responses. Though I do not have much knowledge about Dyscalculia, It appears that you've prepared very well for the research. Good luck on your proposal and actual research."	9/26/2015 17:27	122		
Student86	Misc3	1	Great response to your personal question. This is actually good question from your mentor .. and it appears that you have a great understan[lastname]g about your topic and related areas.

Student15	Student28	1	"Don't surveys dis-engage the users, if the user is not interested in the content, will they actually engage in provi[lastname]g feedback that can be used as a measurement mechanism for the course's effectiveness if that is your final objective?"	9/26/2015 18:49	137	4	
Student15	Student79	1	"The idea of a web reader in the era of AI is interesting. While I was intrigued by your project, the personal question was how not over complicate your product/app/implementation, from your response, it was difficult for me to understand how you are accomplishing that, but overall your thought process seem to be striving for an interesting educational technology. Good luck!!"	9/26/2015 18:52	225	6	
Student97	Student70	1	"Based on your answers i think you have solid idea of what your project will be. Scrutinizing your meta information i have some points that might be useful for your project. hosting provider: I don't know in what way hosting provider information will be useful, in my opinion user doesn't need to care about where the blog is hosted, its all in the cloud. topic and concepts seems similar. Comments: you should also consider many web now has disabled in-site comment and let their readers commenting on twitter. You can also add reputation algorithm similar to algorithm used by search engine to rank relevant websites."	9/26/2015 21:22	3452	5	
Student97	Student37	1	"Based on your answer, i think you already have solid idea of what your research would look like. One thing you should also mention is effectiveness measurement since your goal is maximizing innovation and collaboration, you need a way to demonstrate that your method works."	9/26/2015 22:19	1634		
Student97	Student91	1	"Your project is very interesting, based on your answer i think you have solid idea of what your project will be. Although in mini proposal data design is not required, your definition of frames data structure are clear and i can see it will be able to support any MOOC subject. In draft proposal you can expand this into more detailed frame and its relations."	9/26/2015 22:47	2073	7	
Student97	Student68	1	I can see you have compelling arguments in your answer but i don't quite grasp what exactly your research topic is. You should included a brief overview of your topic in this writing so that your reader can understand the context better.	9/26/2015 23:21	542		
Student34	Student92	1	"I think this is going to be interesting, though I wonder how easy it'll realistically be to make actual co[lastname]g exercises small enough that they would be usable for spaced repetition. One of the major downfalls of the use of spaced repetition is that people don't stick with it, and co[lastname]g exercises tend to be complicated enough that the time required would be a serious burden. On the other hand, something that simplifies the questions down enough to make it very workable to take that approach easily seems like it's going to end up being less sophisticated than a site like Codecademy. It might be that what you're picturing already solves this and I'm just not quite grasping the plan properly, so I'm really just musing here about what's going to happen with the complexity of the work you're doing."	9/26/2015 22:36	694		
Student34	Student16	1	"I'm curious about how you plan to make the timing algorithm work and to [firstname]gh it against existing algorithms that perform the same function.

Student34	Student35	0	"I feel like I must not be following what you're saying properly when it comes to the type of projects that tend to be done in an academic setting. You say that engineering courses are concerned with implementations of complete systems, but then you go on to use developing a threa[lastname]g library but not a complete application as a project. It seems like these two things are in conflict with each other, since a person who's developing a threa[lastname]g library is not developing a complete system (OS) as you say."	9/26/2015 23:51	69		
Student34	Student1	1	"You say that the platforms used for online programs are problematic, but I'm curious what you feel that we should be taking away from that. Are the platforms poten[firstname]lly worse than just doing without a centralized platform, or is it that they're not as good as we'd like them to be? When you're talking about adult learners and non-traditional students, it sounds like we're talking about part-time students also. How do you think their lives compare with students of more traditional ages who happen to go to school part time and in a more traditional on campus setting? I'm just thinking about this with respect to the fact that completion rates among students who can't afford to commit full time aren't great anyway (and aren't even great for people who do go full time at the traditional college age, really). So I'm trying to pick out what's really distinct about adult students that makes them a separate category."	9/27/2015 0:17	417	4

Student20	Student13	1	You seem to have a very clear and concise goal for your project and plan of action. Very impressive! I enjoyed your breakdown of attributes of effectiveness of educational technology.	9/26/2015 23:19	295	4	Nice to get some positive feedback!
Student20	Student60	1	"I really enjoyed your project idea. I have many times found myself sifting through tons of piazza posts trying to find suitable team mates for a project or making a post and having it buried and ignored. A tool such as yours would be a great asset to the OMSCS program. The idea of having study groups, open ended and closed groups is very intriguing and should make the tool very flexible. I look forward to seeing what comes of your project!"	9/26/2015 23:25	317	6	The feedback was good. It was helpful.
Student20	Student46	1	"Very intriguing project! I have also considered an educational game for my project, but was more towards a sandbox style game to teach physics. It can be very difficult to teach students effectively with gaming, especially with a younger audience. Allowing the student to create in a game without throwing a ton of symbols and concepts at them is key. ST Math and Dragon Box looks like very interesting products that would be ideal to adopt teaching strategies from. I look forward to seeing what comes of your project!"	9/26/2015 23:30	356	6	
Student20	Student32	1	"Your idea will definitely help with more classes adopting online exams with handwriting recognition. It seems like you have all bases covered with a manual override and a qualified answers database planned. Also, very good on fin[lastname]g a preexisting open API for handwriting recognition. That should allow you to focus more on the process of automatic test evaluation rather than wasting a ton of time figuring out the mechanics of it. Good luck and I look forward to seeing what comes of your project!"	9/26/2015 23:36	418		
Student55	Student30	2	"Wow - the way you consulted with actual teachers on this question is incredible! The case study approach really gives life to your picture of the state of the EdTech art. I found the formatting (no in-line references) a bit challenging for a couple of pieces of data - for instance, you said that most classrooms have smart boards today, and I struggled to find the source so I could learn more details (e.g., is this across all levels? just K-12? etc.). Would have loved to see footnotes or cite notes on this. This is a very minor point, however. I'm now excited to see what you end up creating. Happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/27/2015 0:39	102	6	I appreciate the validation on the case studies/real-world anecdotes. Point taken on the inline references.
Student55	Student9	1	"This was a very interesting read overall. In places, I struggled to understand how it related to the question; I felt as though it was operating at a very abstract level, and I needed something more concrete to wrap my mind around. The part that felt most meaningful to me was the statement, ""Success in an educational game *is* proof of learning. If success is possible without learning, the design of the game is fundamentally flawed."" I feel as though the obvious follow-on question is: what techniques could you use to measure that correlation between learning and game success? If you answer this I think you will have made a breakthrough. I'm looking forward to seeing what you create... happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/27/2015 0:41	426		
Student55	Student101	1	"You have some interesting thoughts in this piece - your central thesis, about less tech-savvy instructors underestimating the usefulness of their technology, feels like the complement of the law of the instrument. This makes an excellent case for technology outreach aimed at teachers. The overall plan still seems a little vague. It would be ideal if you could include one or two examples of techniques you are considering, and what you think they will accomplish. For instance, you mention performing research with a survey; whom would you target and what area would you hope to illuminate with it? Good luck, and happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/27/2015 0:48	490	6	
Student55	Student6	2	"This is a really tantalizing essay! It does a great job of outlining the major challenges to your project; after rea[lastname]g it, I feel you have a very clear concept of what you need to do in order to bring it to fruition. Not central to this assignment, but while I recall bits and pieces that you've mentioned about your project on the forum, I struggled a bit to understand the context - it might be valuable to include a ""cheat sheet"" explaining the project. (Then again, the remaining assignment is the project proposal, which will be fairly self-contained. So this is unlikely to be necessary from here on out.) It will be pretty neat to see your simulator come to life. Good luck, and happy buil[lastname]g!"	9/27/2015 0:56	249	6	"Yeah, I realized after submitting that I should have included the prior assignments to provide better context."
Student65	Student45	1	Your mini-proposal was very informative. I am a teacher and I haven't thought about the details you've brought forward in this paper before. You've given me a lot to think about. The only thing I was not sure about was what your project is. Will you be doing a research study and comparative analysis of the different tools you mentioned? Will you be developing a best practices protocol for educational UX? This all sounds like very worth-while effort. Good luck!	9/27/2015 0:18	2300		
Student65	Student86	1	"I teach high school computer science but I am familiar with existing curriculum and [lastname]es being made currently in the area of STEM coursework. At our 7th grade level, students have a technology course that lasts one quarter of the year. It traditionally encompassed things like wood working and computer aided drafting. They are updating that curriculum currently to include more higher-skilled topics such as programming. One thing to keep in mind with assigning programming homework is that you cannot assume students have access at home. For many schools, particularly urban schools, students might not have computer or internet access at home. Even among districts like mine where most students have a computer, you might be using tools that are not cross-platform, in which case you have to be careful about what you assign. For example, in my intro CS class I teach Visual Basic (the worth of that up for debate), but the point is that the IDE is only available on Windows machines and so any student whose family is MAC based will be at a disadvantage. Therefore in that class, all programming work must be done at school, and homework is more traditional non-programming based (like rea[lastname]g, written homework, project planning, etc.). You addressed that when you said you would use online tools, but still, the concept of no internet at home persists. As a side-note, you'd be surprised at how often I find that the ""my internet went down last night"" is the new ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. A question I have for you is whether or not your curriculum would be elective-based or required for all students. The reason for the question is that Java is not an easy language to learn, if the target audience is middle school kids, you will find that there will be few who can pick that up. For those it could be great, but for the majority it would be very difficult. So consider that if you intend for the curriculum to be required coursework. I'm not sure I agreed with the statement that ""students will not have trouble learning from an online system"". In my lower level classes that include students that are not all necessarily going on to major in Computer Science (that is the nice way to say it), they need to be walked through certain algorithmic tasks several times, and need one-on-one assistance and guidance, especially as they start out. And these are typically 10th graders. It is easy to assume students can handle the work because any of us in this program could have at that age, but this is not universally applicable. Over all I like your topic and will be interested in seeing your results after you develop your curriculum."	9/27/2015 0:56	1061		
Student65	Student52	1	"This is fascinating! I agree with your wife that rea[lastname]g students is hard enough, for a human. I am a teacher, so I am familiar with the challenges associated with rea[lastname]g individual students WHILE you are trying to teach a class, and that is very difficult without the aid of a formative assessment to get quantitative evidence. I can't help but to wonder if an AI agent would actually do better than a human at this task?"	9/27/2015 1:14	625	6	
Student65	Student59	2	I didn't know the Flesch-Kincaid metric was included in word. Good to know. From that it could be used to see what level a student is writing at too.

Is there an in-depth algorithm that is going to be designed to achieve this? As narcolepsy is unique and your solution is to be made broad are there other conditions that too would need a special approach to the cognitive state?

I also decided to include incentives and gamification elements into my design.

The ai behind the auto grader would have to extremely advanced and now I know to always make my essays really long to get a good score :-). It appears some existing solutions to look into are eRater, Intellimetric, Project Essay Grade[48], and PaperRater. Perhaps look into how these applications approached the problem and see if there is any open base source code to expand upon so it is not built from the ground up. Great job and best of luck!"	9/27/2015 1:10	534	6	"Thanks [firstname]! As you pointed out, it's not possible to build a full-fledged automated essay scorer in one semester. That is why the focus of my research is on how one aspect of AES' can be improved by using a new algorithm called skip-thought vectors. I will try to build some rudimentary logic for lower-level traits, but that will be a stretch goal. Paperrater looks really neat, it's a shame they have a max length of 20 pages even when paying."
Student4	Student99	2	As a teacher I had persistent problem of students copying source code from fellow students and online sources. Tools that I have tried till now have brought mixed results. From this text it looks like you are attempting to target areas which most of the tools lack. Would be exciting to use this tool once it takes concrete shape	9/27/2015 0:19	2842		
Student4	Student50	2	A thorough research on the topic. I concur with the observations on fin[lastname]gs on low retention rates. One overarching reason that I found in my class students (undergrads in computer science) is that they are at a time going through 3-4 courses. Once the sessional and final tests on these courses approach they do not find sufficient time to complete MOOC courses which though are state of the art but at the same time deman[lastname]g	9/27/2015 1:06	416

Student84	kjiwani7@gatech.edu	1	"The last question where the mentor asks ""what business models are reasonable for supporting such environments?"". I think you may have not answered the right question. When I read the question, what my take on the question was this: What business model - out there could benefit from your idea/project - by supporting an environment - like yours. So I don't think he/she was asking about a business model to wrap around your project but asking what types of businesses would benefit from this proposal in a value add sort of way. Overall technically very much an excellent piece of work. Good luck."	9/27/2015 6:40	546		
Student84	Student56	1	"Good responses. I'd like to ask an overall general question about your topic. Something to think about. Also before I ask, let me say I understand that you're not supporting nor rejecting any educational system by choosing to topic in the area of stealth assessment. I can see the benefits. I follow your comparisons, but even though it may look somewhat similar to a question asked of you already, my question is, in the end of a quarter, semester or even a school year, how has stealth assessment helped in teaching a young mind of a 17 or 18 year old in Freshman year of college to learn? I think right now you're thinking, I already answered that! If that's the case, let me word my question as a general wondering. I wonder if stealth assessments should be used as an assessment tool to measure successes and failures of other education methods rather than a tool to assess the student. Because the way I see it, at the student level the stealth assessment tools work similar to non-mandatory hw assignments I had during calc classes. I always liked math, calc, algebra, etc but never enjoyed repeating the same solution formula 10 times (hw are pretty much that). So how can a stealth assessment tool distinguish me and a classmate that didn't do any work because he or she just didn't care. So my final thought is basically what I said earlier: I wonder if stealth assessments is better suited as an assessment tool to measure successes and failures of other education methods rather than a tool to assess the student. Thanks, Good luck :)"	9/27/2015 6:49	1569	6	
Student84	Student40	1	"I think you answered the questions pretty well. Although some of if not all the questions probably will be answered in your proposal in a more structured bulletined manner. My only suggestion is if you've been doing this sort of work for a long time then use the style of project management that's comfortable for you, but if this is one of the first few larger projects I recommend a good thorough task list of items that are needed and the work that needs to be done for them. The tasklist probably should be about 50% software and 50% the outline of the efforts that go into taking it from the idea to presentation (25%), (code would be presentation to product)(50%), and the product to [firstname]et (25%). Good luck"	9/27/2015 7:15	710		
Student84	Student7	1	"I was a little confused as what the question was. It read more like a statement to me. But it reads as if you and your mentor are on the same page and have the ideas basics in common. I had the same style of personal question from my mentor, but I messaged back and asked if the question could be cleared. Good luck."	9/27/2015 7:27	355

Student92	Student98	1	"This is a great subject for research. I think that education could benefit greatly by increased amount and granularity of statistics. My greatest concern when this subject comes up is not simply the privacy of the students, but the rights of the students. Parents, research, government, and private education sectors get a boon from this research, as do future students, but I am concerned about the right to data of students who are not yet old enough to prevent that data from being collected. I know that you had addressed the issues of privacy in your personal statement, but I would love to hear more about issues coming from the voice of the persons the data collected. Nonetheless, I think this is an important research area and I am happy that someone is tackling it this semester."	9/27/2015 7:45	341
