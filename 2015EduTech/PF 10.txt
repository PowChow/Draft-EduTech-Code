Student61	Student75	2	Wow. I actually would like to use this right now! Great look under the hood too about how you structured your tool.	12/7/2015 12:31	655	5	Thanks!
Student61	Student5	2	"This is awesome! I just added your production site to my favorites. This serves as a great way to aggregate user resources. I went through one of the courses I took and did well in and the resources were spot on! Slick UI/UX! Does it have an update feature where you can ""watch a courses resources for [lastname]es and updates?"	12/7/2015 12:42	2164		
Student61	Student38	1	Great way to back up the value of integrity! Neat tool. I would have liked to see more of what the research you have done. I ran across OverCode http://people.csail.mit.edu/elg/overcode and it seems like MOSS-TAPS could be used in a similar fashion. Or maybe combine the two tools.	12/7/2015 13:19	808		
Student61	Student2	2	This is great! I usually have to make flashcards myself to review. I have used the SlickQuiz github project too. Great work! great ui/ux.	12/7/2015 13:45	112		
Student5	Student72	1	It is exciting to see how the proven Montessori model come into life in the browser. Great job and hope it can really help some in the future.	12/7/2015 13:09	289	4	
Student5	Student38	1	Great Job! Moss is definitely hard to use and your program will make it a lot easier for instructors and TAs to interact with MOSS.	12/7/2015 13:14	519		
Student5	Student2	1	Great Idea!! I do believe in microlearning and I like your approach of a cross-platform hybrid app.	12/7/2015 13:23	251		
Student5	Student75	1	This is a great idea. It has the capability help our registration system so much! Good Job!	12/7/2015 13:27	348	5	Thanks!
Student96	Student51	1	"Awesome project! It looks like you did a great job. Hopefully this is helpful feedback.... I spend half of my time watching the demo wondering what types of videos it would make. Obviously, they wouldn't be just looking at an R2D2 model. Would they be for adults maintaining a machine or kids assembling a model? Are they watching video lectures and answering questions. I don't doubt that the tool could be used for all of them, but I think the demo would have more impact if you said something like ""for example, imagine a teacher that wants to produce a video on subject x. They would need to shoot a series of clips such as a,b,c. Later they would want to test comprehensive of these tasks with questions like 1,2,3"". In a sense, I just want to see you to produce a more believable clip."" I hope you don't mind. It's such a great project I just wanted to try to be helpful."	12/7/2015 13:15	396		
Student96	Student19	1	"Wow! Such a cool project. I love the sequencing and the UI. Watching, I kept thinking about what would come next as students get the basics. It reminded me of ScribD's fruit robot javascript game in which you give a basic level of programming for a robot and have a tournament. I could see the competitive nature helping inspire kids to take things to the next level. Here it is in case it's useful: https://scribdtech.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/compete-against-our-developers/"	12/7/2015 13:22	413	7	
Student96	Student80	1	"Cool project! I played the game when it popped up on Piazza and didn't really know what to think. Actually, I first thought it was the thing where 100 prisoners get to send one into a room per day and if all have been in and he/she knows so, they can go home. I played a bit and didn't understand what was going on. Though I love the analysis that you got from it. I can totally understand what you mean by people not being able to play against each other. Anyway, I hope submitting the paper goes well if that's your next step. Very nice work!"	12/7/2015 13:29	377	5	"Good to know about confusion. Most poten[firstname]l participants would probably give up and not play, so such feedback is unusual. However, it is helpful on aggregate, and not something I can act on immediately."
Student96	Student33	2	"Wow! Great project. Honestly, it made me feel a little ashamed for not doing something more applicable to helping people that need an extra hand. To be honest, the video was a little hard to watch. Maybe it was a little slow. Though I stuck through and paid attention to every detail because it felt like you worked on a very important thing. I would love to read the paper that goes along with it. One thought kept coming back to me. How much is simply access to the hardware for the kids? Raspberry Pi Zero is a great point. I remember 20 years ago going to Jamaica with my father who was teaching in Montego Bay. We all gathered as many old computers as we could carry because they outfitted a makeshift computer lab. I'm not sure how many students ended up ""using"" it as a lab because it was mostly like a workshop where a bunch of students/teachers tinkered to get computers working in the evenings. Chances are that they took them back to their own schools after the semester was over. Many of them studied hard to get chalk and erasers so I imagine a computer was hard to come by. The informal aspect made more sense than any sort of ""class"" structure. It reminds me of the ""bicycle collective"" that a friend started in Salt Lake City in which they solicit donated free bicycles, new parts, and $, and would offer classes where people learn to maintain them. Kids also had an ""earn a bike"" program in which they strip one down to the frame, get it repainted and build it up with new parts. The sense of ownership helps them take care of it and knowing how to maintain it helps ensure it won't just break and get lost. They also offer shop time so you can always come in and rent a bench and get expert help. He talked about doing something similar with computers. It makes me wonder how much is possible on that model. The bicycle thing was enough to make him friends with the mayor and they ended up buying three buil[lastname]gs so they had presence in other towns. Though it always seemed like a startup company with lots of people and piles of old bikes around. They also [lastname]sformed the city to be more bicycle friendly. For example, farmers [firstname]ets used to have a few people show up on bikes and then 10 years later, they would ""valet park"" 1000 bikes per [firstname]et. Anyway...just passing it along in case it's useful. I hope you continue the work and help lots of smart kids get a leg up. I can't remember the numbers but they would distribute thousands and thousands of bicycles per year over 15+ years."	12/7/2015 13:41	704		
Student85	Student46	0	"Pretty nice! I follow your logic as far as the ball/pipe teaching pattern goes and it makes sense to me. I didn't pick up on the point of the banana game as completely in that I was hoping to see something in a matching of decimal numbers to resulting bananas, but that may just be me. Good idea to teach them young - I didn't learn binary until I was in my twenties, by which time my mind was old and fossilized!"	12/7/2015 13:22	319	6	
Student85	Student44	1	"Interesting research, [firstname]. I particularly found meaning in your Fin[lastname]g 3 documenting the discrepancy between college administrators and students in regard to motivation. [firstname]ly, I'm amazed by the disconnect given that virtually every classroom instructor in the country laments the lack of motivation of many students."	12/8/2015 13:20	144		
Student85	Student82	1	"Nice clean UI ready for styling! I enjoyed your description of the architecture, the use of SignalR for interactive communication with the client, and the recorder queue - very nice."	12/8/2015 21:44	492		
Student85	Student12	2	"Very slick application! I remember your concept from earlier in the course and honestly didn't see the point of if at the time. Now I see the value of your tool - great work! I hope that OMSCS will embrace it and make it an official part of the program. Again, great work!"	12/8/2015 21:52	574		
Student22	Student67	2	"Hi [firstname], Very nice tool - your statistics are impressive - I have seem much the same similar numbers in the St. Louis area (which is where I am from). Your point about students not seeing what the relevance of what they are being taught to real life is important. Giving motivational stories such at this may go a long way in helping someone stay with it in school. If they can do it then so can I ! (is what I think you are attempting to get across) - along with others who are using the app - a network of people. Question: How are the videos selected? Are they preselected based on interests or somehow dynamically updated over time? Good job! I am sure you will get a good grade in the class!"	12/7/2015 13:34	168		
Student22	Student50	2	"Hi [firstname], Nice presentation - very good music too. My teams report is somewhat similar using many charts and graphs taken from 1,100 survey's on corporate training I have found them to be very useful. In the same vein I see that your project will also be quite useful for the academic community at Ga Tech so they can improve the program if they know more about the student base over many semesters - this is the start! These insights will be useful - your point about having more data to make sure that one or two people do not skew the results is insightful. I was aware of your project as I participated in it. Good Luck! I am sure you will get a good grade in the class - Enjoy your holiday season!"	12/7/2015 13:42	199		
Student22	Student4	2	Hello! Very nice and impressive - your implementation reminds me of the tools in W3Schools in working with JavaScript and HTML example code and try it functionality. Except you go a step future and verify the results for them -- quite nice. I teach computer science myself and I always tell students you have to understand the problem before you can solve it; this is exactly what you're trying to teach ! Good job! I am sure you will do well in the class and get a great grade. Have a Happy Holiday Season!	12/7/2015 13:49	206		
Student22	Student100	2	"Hi [firstname] and [firstname], I was unhappy that I could not rate it WAY BEYOND the EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS! What can I say but Wow! You two put a lot of work into this and I tried the site and it worked great for me! Good intro music in your video and demo. It would be nice to see more [lastname]sparency in auto grader tools such as you have here with Auger. My other class is Machine Learning for Tra[lastname]g this fall and I know they have had considerable problems with Auto gra[lastname]g tools during the course, perhaps a tool such as yours would help here - I do not know for sure as the auto gra[lastname]g process used by Ga Tech is a mysterious black box to me. I see you thought through this process very thoroughly, with options for regular credit, extra credit or non-credit, the override function is nice too as somethings there are other items to be considered and you give the teacher the option to [lastname]e that. Even ad[lastname]g the API reference was a great touch too. I would be shocked if you didn't get the best grade possible in the class! Enjoy your Holiday Season - and take a good rest.... I know you both have earned it! Student22"	12/7/2015 14:22	482		
Student38	Student85	1	Great job on explaining the project. I feel like your presentation gave the right amount of depth and viewing to give a teacher a good idea of whether this is an app they want to try.	12/7/2015 13:53	556		
Student38	Student72	1	"Very thorough presentation on your charming shapes project. Getting the graphic game to work ""just so"" looks like a challenge. I think you could have left out the code review - it wasn't really necessary for understan[lastname]g your project, though I was personally interested to know the language you implemented with. It was interesting to hear about the actual testing in a pre-school class. Great job!"	12/8/2015 15:11	122	4	
Student38	Student75	1	Good job on creating a complex project. I hope you will be able to successfully deploy it on AWS!	12/8/2015 15:20	219	5	Thanks!
Student38	Student2	2	Artimo looks great. I can also imagine a more self-service use for it by study groups in online courses. Wouldn't it be great to have each study group member ad[lastname]g questions for the group. Very exciting!	12/8/2015 15:24	1644		
Student97	Student96	1	"Hi [firstname]. Your project is cool, lot of great features implemented, I am sure it will be helpful for your developer community. Is it published on public server already? Can I try your app?"	12/7/2015 14:31	529		
Student97	Student45	2	"Wow, this tool is super cool, I wish I had this before I jumped into omscs. You are all doing really great job!"	12/7/2015 14:40	406		
Student97	Student26	2	Cool project. This tool will make gra[lastname]g much more scalable and especially useful in MOOC context. Well done!	12/7/2015 14:47	352	4	thanks
Student97	Student19	2	"This apps is really helpful for kids, and today is also an hour of code. Your block based co[lastname]g is natural for kids, like in lego where you have to put bricks into a structure."	12/7/2015 14:53	189	6	
Student6	Student77	1	"The project looks interesting, and you summarized the technical details and features very well. Honestly, I found the music distracting, but couldn't turn it off as I was waiting for someone to present something. Around the 2:00 [firstname], the word Features is misspelled, and I believe it is cron job, not chron job?"	12/7/2015 14:52	185		
Student6	Student21	2	I loved this presentation. A great mix of music/overview combined with actual usage of the application. Looks like a fantastic application!	12/8/2015 0:59	140		
Student6	Student60	1	"Video was a little long, but informative and went through most of the features of the website."	12/8/2015 1:04	751	6	The feedback was helpful.
Student6	Student52	1	"I'm looking for more of a presentation. The video was good, but would have liked more detail in it."	12/8/2015 1:17	404	6	
Student1	Student60	1	Interesting approach to solving the problem of isolation in online only courses.	12/7/2015 16:02	29	6	The feedback was helpful.
Student1	Student78	1	Neat concept! Have you consider buil[lastname]g a mobile version for a future release?	12/7/2015 16:03	129		
Student1	Student6	2	That device looks very complicated. A hands on simulator for training makes a lot sense. Good work!	12/7/2015 16:10	634		
Student1	Student77	1	It's a nice concept and a slick presentation.	12/7/2015 16:23	44		
Student40	Student63	1	"Hi [firstname]! I enjoyed watching your presentation video! Your project reminded me in a lot of ways of the early games I used to play with in elementary school where typically we had to solve some math or English problems in order to be able to play a game. When I saw your introductory game with the basketball player it reminded me of a ""Gorilla"" game from when I was small (essen[firstname]lly two different gorillas were on opposite sides of the map and then were throwing explosive bananas at each other and you had you had to adjust some values on each turn and try and get closer and closer to the enemy gorilla to take him out). There's also a newer physics-based game that has similar mechanics named ""Worms"" that I also really enjoyed due to those same type of mechanics (so I guess what I'm trying to say is that at least some kids will find that type of game fun/enjoyable :-). I don't remember those games provi[lastname]g any hints though to help guide the learning process, which is I believe one of the main advantages of an Intelligent Tutor System, and that's what you were trying to achieve in your project :-). It was interesting what you shared about the Bayesian Model being somewhat difficult to implement because it needed more time to create (it made me feel somewhat better that I wasn't the only one that wasn't able to complete all of my stated goals in my proposal :-). Also thanks for sharing the names of the things you used to build the project (such as Pygame) it might be something I'll take a look at in the future! As you described at the end of your video (and it's something I also saw in the project trailers a few weeks ago) it seems like quite a bit of your future work is tied to ad[lastname]g more content / feedback (which always seems to be the hard part I think, because you essen[firstname]lly have to know all of those things and build all of the animations, etc. which is a lot of work with a small team). I think the most interesting part of that future work though would be coming up with a way of measuring the effectiveness of the game-based learning compared to more traditional methods (I certainly feel like it was somewhat helpful in my early years, but I couldn't really quantify how much of an impact it had on me...research into that area would definitely be interesting :-). I hope you are able to continue work on your project after the semester is completed! -[firstname] P.S. I happened to notice the little Lego movie you made of Steve there in your Youtube channel...if that's your boy, then he's a cute one (and I can see why you are interested in buil[lastname]g these systems, probably to have available for him to learn from :-)! Have a Happy Holidays!"	12/7/2015 16:26	2636		
Student40	Student34	1	"Hi [firstname]! Thank you for sharing what you learned in your project using Peer Feedback to see if it would improve the learning experience in CS 6505. I was definitely one of those students last Fall that completely failed that class (I thought about withdrawing, but was given enough encouragement by my peers in Piazza that made me feel if I stuck through it I might pass...alas, it was not to be :-). So I definitely appreciate research into ways to help make students more successful in the course (because it was definitely a subject area I wanted to learn about and understand, but I couldn't quite make all the leaps required throughout the semester, though I could usually reach an ""a-ha"" moment for the homeworks...I definitely couldn't take that to the Exams and it was particularly traumatic :-(. I think the most interesting part of your project though was discovering that the homework assignments didn't really provide any good correlations with the exam grades (and since I believe Peer Feedback was tied to just the homeworks, it therefore indicated that the Peer Feedback, while possibly useful on the homework assignments, didn't end up improving exam grades). I don't know how much the assignments have [lastname]ed in the last year, but I'm pretty sure I can agree it was the same when I took the course last Fall too. If there were a way to make the homeworks more effective or maybe at least count for a bit more of the grade maybe that would be helpful (but it could also indicate that the material just needs to be expanded and explained in more detail and really help those of us who never took a similar course in undergrad get the foundation they might need to understand better). I look forward to what you come up with (so that I might be able to take the course again in the future and have a better experience :-)! Happy Holidays! -Student40"	12/7/2015 17:10	1281		
Student40	Student74	1	"Hi [firstname]/[firstname]/[firstname], Nice work on putting something together that looks pretty complete :-)! I wasn't sure though...was your project called ""ViMo 2"" or ""modelearn""? (I saw both in the video and the video title on the Youtube page so I wasn't sure). Looking back to the early weeks in the semester when I believe I saw [firstname]'s video of his son where he used this approach it definitely seems like you guys have put together something that will meet those needs very nicely! Well done :-). There are a few small UI things that can probably be improved, but there were also some nice touches you guys had already added (such as the coloring of the video timeline bar accor[lastname]g to the specific task) and it all flowed together pretty nicely. I really hope you guys are able to put it out there on the Apple Store for others to check out in the near future (I'm sure in addition to autistic children it will be helpful for all parents wanting to teach their kids how to do things more correctly/better too :-). If you do, please send me an email! -Student40 (orware@gmail.com / Student40)"	12/7/2015 17:32	1569		
Student40	Student101	1	"Hi [firstname]! Great overview video on the process you ended up using to conduct your research! I'd like to start off by requesting a copy of it if possible, to be sent to, Student40 (or orware@gmail.com) please (I feel like there's some neat stuff in there we might be able to learn from for my own college that I work for :-). I think overall your response rate was actually pretty good considering (about 50%), which compared to a mass email survey (where the response rate is usually only a few % unless the population is really interested by the subject or is required to do it). I'm still a bit concerned on the format for the final paper since I didn't really know which conference fit for mine (and since it was a project, it seemed the business plan approach seemed more appropriate, but also overly long for what I wanted to communicate). I'm glad you were able to get through that process without too much issue (I think part of the issue I would have is fully understan[lastname]g/knowing what format the conference is requesting...from some of the comments on Piazza it seemed like in some cases it was a little tricky to find out). Lastly, I just wanted to comment that you did an excellent job keeping all of your data/material organized from what I saw in the video, so I just wanted to send some kudos regar[lastname]g that! Thank you for sharing your project with us and Happy Holidays! -Student40"	12/7/2015 17:58	730	7	
Student28	Student40	1	"[firstname], this looks like a good tool, however, the list of videos are long to go over. My recommendation is to setup a high level overview video w/in 5minutes to preview the tool and provided this playlist as an option for someone who wants to go into more details. Good job and best of luck next semester!"	12/7/2015 17:21	976		
Student28	Student73	1	"Hi [firstname], this looks great and could be a great buddy with iReady. I hope the APIs we shared are helpful to you! Great job and best of luck next semester!"	12/7/2015 17:38	142		
Student28	Student24	1	TeamUp looks like a very useful tool for OMSCS! Best of luck with it!	12/7/2015 17:40	270	6	Thanks [firstname].
Student28	Student64	1	This is a an interesting and noble topic to research! One of the things that the middle school in our area doing is len[lastname]g laptops (Mac Air) to students to use to eliminate the access to equipment as a barrier for kids form lower income families. Best of luck next semester!	12/7/2015 17:45	445	7	Thanks! That is great to hear!
Student20	Student36	2	"Very interesting research fin[lastname]gs, especially about the correlation of midterm grades to piazza posts. The MyOle tool is very impressively done and appears to be very feature filled, especially considering the relatively short time span for development. It will be interesting to see how your tool evolves in the workplace!"	12/7/2015 19:15	456	6	
Student20	Student11	1	"Very creative and thoughtful project. Such a project would also serve to clean up a lot of the redundant posts on Piazza if students can see questions about quizzes and videos asked and answered using the plugin. The only concerns I would have going forward are how the system reacts when certain lecture segments are updated or [lastname]ed. Also maybe add the ability to have a professor moderate the comments. Overall, very impressive and innovative project!"	12/7/2015 19:26	179		
Student20	Student86	1	"As an adult learner recently out into the corporate culture, I have recently experienced all types of education discussed in the video. The Ebbinghaus Forgetting curve was particularly interesting, as was the research on using humor to reenforce learning."	12/7/2015 19:30	527		
Student20	Student59	1	"Very impressive project, also very impressed at the amount of content and how you were able to automatically retrieve it. The underlying program logic seems like it will be a very solid basis for future iterations. The user friendly front-end that you are planning will certainly be a challenge but the core program functionality is definitely useful in it's current form."	12/7/2015 19:39	643		
Student24	Student74	2	Very neat app. I am really impressed how the app has progressed since my last review of the proposal. You guys have achieved substan[firstname]l amount of development work here. The app seems to be very intuitive and easy to follow through with easy steps to create your video presentations. Also more important it seems to incorporate the fun element into actual video modelling learning process. Well Done! Great Job!	12/7/2015 19:23	63		
Student24	Student40	1	I think the video presentations do a good job of describing the road-map for system setup inclu[lastname]g software installation and configuration to get someone easily up and running for exten[lastname]g the project. The actual application seems to have sketched out the Instructor specific workflow and with a little TODO list for next steps would prove to be handy for someone interested in continuing the project. I think you have built the overall skeleton for the project pretty well so that anyone can easily takeover and add the application level workflow logic.	12/7/2015 19:25	546		
Student24	Student34	2	"The study does a great job of comparative analysis between correlation of homework assignments and student performance on the Exams. I am somewhat surprised why students wont take advantage of easy extra credit points by simply giving feedback, especially since you are struggling for every single opportunity to score in this class. For someone who has avoided taking CS 6505, this was an eye opener for me at the amount of time and work involved on homework assignments which does not really guarantee getting better understan[lastname]g of the subject topics. I found the presentation to be very informative. I think you have done a wonderful job and coming this from a TA's perspective it adds much more value to the study fin[lastname]gs. Hopefully the results of this study can help address some of the issues that have been identified. Perhaps it might be worthwhile to offer an Introductory level course to supplement some to the basic concepts before taking this course. Something on the lines of Intro to Operating Systems."	12/7/2015 19:40	601		
Student24	Student64	2	Very well done research study Cycil. The study clearly identifies the goals and its target audience. I am very impressed that you have incorporated data from multiple sources to improve the validity of your research. The study does a great job of identifying the challenges faced by majority of low income group members and constraints on schools who are strapped for fun[lastname]g in those districts which restrict them from participating in development programs. It presents a stark contrast of Race specific breakdown of predominant IT professionals in Silicon valley. The conclusion does a good job of highlights some of the immediate steps that can be taken to effectively bridge educational and technological gap which exists among low income group members of society. Good Job!!	12/7/2015 20:26	117	7	Thanks for the feedback. We were worried about what the viewers would think we missed and tried to incorporate as much as we could.
Student16	Student47	1	"I love the idea of this paper, but rating this based on the video only (no paper), I was a little lost. Would have preferred that you summarize the paper a little more, give examples of what you learned so I have more context."	12/7/2015 19:23	293		
Student16	Student94	1	"I'd recommend more of an intro, I thought you were doing a paper on sales techniques for Montessori programs at first. I like the app, would love to see more rewards (points, positive feedback, etc) upon ""succee[lastname]g"". What does this app teach?"	12/7/2015 19:28	302		
Student16	Student35	1	"Interesting idea, would like to have seen you go a little more into the benefits of this or if there's options to run real-time so students can see how they are doing relative to their peers."	12/7/2015 19:33	170

Student49	Student92	1	"Good job, I see where you are going with this. Seems there is a good framework to build off of, but you may want to rethink the layout, the background makes the text hard to read on your left pane with the moving city graphic in the background"	12/7/2015 19:45	415		
Student49	Student37	2	"This is quite obviously the best project here, since I put so much blood sweat and tears into it, haha. Not sure why I got our project to rate, but it is well deserving of the top rating ;-)"	12/7/2015 19:52	99		
Student49	Student81	1	"Well this technology certainly seems viable in the coming years, we have only been promised it since the 80s, lol. Anyway have been seeing a lot of augmented reality thought going on and saw some really cool Ted talks about it in the past. This one in particular got me excited about it: http://writeoutloud.edublogs.org/2012/11/30/the-sixth-sense-a-must-see-ted-talk-that-will-make-you-go-wow/comment-page-1/ from back in 2012.

Student49	Student70	2	"I think your app turned out really great and can see the benefits of utilizing this in the classroom. I loved the speech functionality, maybe going forward you could think about more challenging levels and leverage voice input as well. Congrats, your hard work has paid off."	12/7/2015 20:07	111		
Student10	Student28	2	"Great video, great project - really happy to see that this was made, I hope that you maintain it! The site is very slick - nice [lastname]sitions, and good organization. One suggestion though is that I think there are too many intermediate links. For example, on https://iready.herokuapp.com/#/skills/C - why not show the articles themselves (or at least previews of them)?"	12/7/2015 20:01	231	7	"That's a good suggestion. The articles are typically much longer, but good point to at least show a little preview. Added to our Nice-To-Haves list."
Student10	Student73	1	"Great work, I think that this is really useful - solves a specific need well I think. Slick UI too. One suggestion that I have is that it would be nice to be able to more easily distinguish between requirement types (ie. ""take 1 from this list, 2 from this list, 3 from this list"") when choosing classes, and to distinguish between planned courses and ones that you've already taken. I hope that you continue this after the semester."	12/7/2015 20:05	516		
Student10	Student24	1	"Great, really nice trailer. 2 minutes of memes was *maybe* a bit excessive (but still funny). How does this tool provide accountability? In group projects, I found that the problem was people not doing their work - not that they were having trouble coor[lastname]ating. So it's not clear to me how this helps that. In terms of keeping people on task though, i seems like it would do the job."	12/7/2015 19:56	2375	6	"Thanks [firstname]. You are right, most of the times I have worked with teams, there is always someone who shy's away from work and finds some excuse to avoid contributing. The part of accountability might come through Peer Feedback specific to project assignments. In general the primary goal of tool is to allow Instructors some mechanism of generating teams based on predefined criteria. Latter on maybe with sufficient data generated over time it will be easy to include a performance evaluation matrix to allow team members to report individual contributions on projects on the lines as done through survey in SDP class."
Student10	Student64	1	"Really interesting fin[lastname]gs. I think that you touched on the heart of the issue of under-representation with teachers just not having access to resources. I also agree that a muti-prong approach is necessary. One suggestion though in terms of statistics is that it might be worth talking about demographics of the states as a whole when comparing minorities. I'm not Am[firstname]an, and I didn't know what percent of the US is African Am[firstname]an or Hispanic, so I wasn't sure what the number should be (I looked it up afterward). Would be interesting to see stats on income vs. enrollment as well. Anyway, I'm interested in rea[lastname]g your report - I'll be sure to check it out when it gets put on piazza. Great work!"	12/7/2015 20:36	548	6	Great feedback that can be looked into if further researched.
Student90	Student24	2	"I was a little conflicted at first. I thought that there were too many jokes making the same point, but at the end I wanted to see more... I certainly can relate to the problem and I really like your solution. Well done!!"	12/7/2015 20:13	188	6	I realized that myself. It was easier for me to tie those together since I knew the concept of my project but it might not make sense for someone who was reviewing my topic first time around. Thanks for feedback [firstname].
Student90	Student73	1	"You have created a really useful app. I used to figure out what courses I have to take next and it really worked!!! An additional feature could be to be able to compare different scena[lastname], maybe compare two specializations to see which track I should follow to graduate earlier."	12/7/2015 20:26	387		
Student90	Student28	1	"I can tell that there was a lot of work and thought put on this project. I think it is a very useful social media tool focused on student experience. One thing that it may be a little dangerous is that, because it seems that it is not moderated, some of the information students enter may not be quite accurate. For instance, I took KBAI and, although I would have found very useful the CV tutorial, CV is not a required skill for the class, in fact, I finished my project without using CV. Still this is a minor issue compare with the achievement of your team in putting this software together. Congratulations!!"	12/7/2015 20:38	282	7	
Student90	Student10	2	This is such a good idea!! English is my second language so I can relate to your strategies. When rea[lastname]g a new book I used to underline all the words that I did not know until the end of the page and then I would go to a dictionary for the meaning. You are dong something very similar. I also agree with your statement that you need to be immerse in the language to learn it well. Good Job and good luck porting your software to a browser.	12/7/2015 20:50	226		
Student37	Student9	1	"WHat i got from this was a solid pan on what you like to do, but I have no idea what you actually did as a study. Did you have an army of teenagers play Civ5 and answer questions?"	12/7/2015 20:07	1046	3	
Student37	Student3	1	"Great Job! There clearly needs to be more research into using tch at schools, and the decision to do so has always been too... easy... and lazy haha"	12/7/2015 20:44	1241	6	
Student37	Student70	2	Fantastic. A fully educational tool and I can just see the possibilities. I love it!	12/10/2015 16:30	14		
Student37	Student81	0	I'm not 100% sure you meant to use this video for this submission. I was under the understan[lastname]g that for this class we would be buil[lastname]g or researching the effects of some kind of learning technology or technical learning technique instead of giving an overview of the technology yet-to-be-out but already highly talked about.	12/10/2015 16:32	219	5	
Student88	Student39	0	"This looks very, very cool! I can immediately see applications of this at high schools across the country. Do you have ways of moving sets of assessments across courses/class? Such that a set of questions can be loaded in each semester instead of having to enter in lots of stuff? The quiz entering question interface is incredibly slick! I cannot say how amazed I am at how easy to use that looks! The dashboard design is incredibly clean and looks like it scales well enough for teachers who probably only have a handful of courses, so no need for anymore than that. Your problem was very well stated, and the details explained perfectly. My only request: can I play with it? :) Great job."	12/7/2015 13:30	663		
Student88	Student22	1	"First, I got to watch your last video and let me just say, this was awesome. Thank you for the images, videos, graphs and charts and most importantly not rea[lastname]g directly from your slides! The video was very well done. As far as the project, the work you three did is very impressive in getting people started with programming. The observations listed around the forgetting curve, humor, etc. were insightful and getting those involved in teaching is great, but also very difficult. Were there any tactics or methods that you used to make sure you were dealing with those issues? How did you overcome them? Make sure you had the right ba[firstname]? etc. Nice work and once again great video."	12/7/2015 13:23	1598		
Student88	Student50	1	"First, the presentation is very well done. I would say that the slides move a little too fast when you state your problems/strategies. By the time I finished looking at the charts and read the problems the slide usually had moved on. I think your 6 categories work very well and align with what I've read from folks' bios on Piazza. The strategies also seem to align with what I hear as common complaints or suggestions. It is interesting at just how different the study body is from a typical undergrad course and as such there is no one size fits all solution. I think your data shows that very well. Nice work."	12/7/2015 13:23	2408		
Student88	Student4	1	"wow! First your interface looks very, very slick. I like how you have things setup. Udacity may have something to learn from you :) The concept and the idea is both excellent and well thought out. What languages would you want to support? Could someone add another language easily? Any security concerns with running code on a system? I really like how you have the lecture section with information on Wikipedia, discussions, and easy downloads all right there. Great job on the video and demo as well!"	12/7/2015 13:23	2772		
Student87	Student77	2	I have to say that your Staq app is probably one of the best projects we have out right now. I saw it on Google+ and it's amazing what you've taken and done in such a short amount of time. GREAT JOB!	12/7/2015 22:05	60		
Student87	Student6	1	I think you had a very good idea on making a wrapper for this technology because it seems very complex even with the wrapper. So using it without the wrapper seems impossible for those that are not trained as programmers. Making technology like this accessible to everyone is a big step towards introducing it to those who may think it is too complex to be undertaken as a topic of study. Great Job!	12/12/2015 17:09	580	5	
Student87	Student1	1	"I think your tool will fix a problem that many students have when they first enter high school: time management. I think that if they have all of the tools right there in front of them as your system does, it will allow them to do everything at a much higher convenience than before when they had to email the professor and actually go to the student forum to ask questions. Putting everything in front of them will allow them to not break their ""flow"" while their studying; thus hopefully increasing grades. Great Project."	12/12/2015 17:26	389	7	
Student87	Student78	1	I think we are going to start seeing more technology like this in order to start getting students more involved in STEM subjects. I think the biggest problem with kids and STEM is that they are not shown enough examples to really gain an intuition about how to solve problems. So I think your solution will really help students accomplish this goal. Great Project.	12/12/2015 17:36	332		
Student82	Student84	1	"Looks like a great project. With a toddler and a baby on the way, this looks like a tool I'd be interested in using."	12/7/2015 22:23	78		
Student82	Student44	1	"In the beginning, you say Fall 2005 instead of Fall 2015 :). For my bachelor's I took the same three courses over the course of three semesters (spring, summer and fall). I would categorize my issues for that year as external and persistence/motivation being the only reason I pushed through the issues and got back on track. I went from at one point almost dropping out of college to now working on my second masters degree. Interesting fin[lastname]gs!"	12/7/2015 22:25	564		
Student82	Student46	1	"Great game! The quality of the video made it difficult to read text. Looks like a great tool for teaching children (or adults!) binary. That's too bad the HTML 5 wasn't working. I think that's the only weakness in the project, but getting Android, iOS and desktop done in one semester is impressive."	12/7/2015 22:34	319	6	
Student82	Student41	1	Great tool! I like the ability to use SMS. This type of tool seems like it'd be very handy for college tutors.	12/7/2015 22:40	541		
Student94	Student35	1	"The tool did a good job based on its design requirements. However, I was not sure the tool actually could do an analysis. It only did an analysis on lines of code, commits etc. which are all qualitative. one line of code could be equivalent in difficulty to 30 lines of code. So the analysis would be misconstrued to assume the one with one line contributed less. It also does not include the design process etc. which is really the brain behind the development."	12/8/2015 7:05	407		
Student94	Student47	0	I could not access the video via the link	12/8/2015 7:22	184		
Student94	Student25	1	Detailed overview on virtualizing remote access	12/8/2015 7:47	49		
Student94	Student68	1	Is it better to start teaching programming at middle school or high school or earlier? It seems different classes could grasp different concepts better. One would think high school students should outperform the middle school students in all areas.	12/8/2015 7:55	272		
Student93	Student2	2	Nice work! I am a creature of habits and I like practicing short quizzes because I fit them easily in the mornings times. But I wouldn't call that a dead time. Not everyone is addicted to their phones and I am an example of that. I would like to see this very soon in the app store. Good luck	12/8/2015 12:13	240		
Student93	Student5	2	I love the concept and I love what you have done with the project. Keep up with it's development -- I believe it will be very popular amongst students	12/8/2015 12:19	66		
Student93	Student38	2	"I am glad you took this project as it is important to simplify the process of verifying student's work. I wish everyone adheres to the honor codes and then this would be unnecessary. However, the reality of 10% cheaters is awful and annoying (I always used to drive me mad when everyone copied my homeworks :) without any consequences). Anyway, continue with the project and I hope it will end up the important tool at GeorgiaTech for professors and TAs"	12/8/2015 12:20	783		
Student51	Student68	1	Hopefully you plan on submitting your work so your data can be usefull to other. Great Job.	12/8/2015 12:12	525		
Student51	Student16	0	Great Work. It be interesting to see you or some one else trail pachylearn in one of the omscs classes next semester. Say a class like Computational Photography where there is already a library of multiple choice questions that could be used in the application. [firstname].	12/8/2015 12:29	183		
Student51	Student35	0	"Looks interesting, would love to see more on how you determined your metrics and ranking system"	12/10/2015 13:12	242		
Student51	Student94	0	Looks like you have a good model for a system. It would be interesting to see you expand it to map's and flag's and other Montessori board activities.	12/10/2015 13:26	48		
Student39	Student100	2	This is totally awesome! I love the idea. I would think something like this would be a great addition to Google Classroom. Some small feedbacks: � description on student rubric is spelled decription � small alignment issues	12/8/2015 13:02	326		
Student39	Student22	1	"Awesome trailer, would love to read the paper to see read up more about the conclusions of your experiment."	12/8/2015 13:09	122		
Student39	Student50	2	"The presentation itself is amazing, informative, and beautiful. Kept me entertained, and I was able to retain the information with the use of graphs. You six profiles are spot on with the individuals I have seen. I am curious to whether the experienced programmers + recent undergrads both faced the same frustration with underprepared peers. Even in the group projects, I notice individuals who have little to know working knowledge of applications development or programming. Good job [firstname]!"	12/8/2015 13:11	374		
Student39	Student4	1	The tool looks pretty good. I am curious to what would be different between you application and something like Udacity? The presentation as a walkthrough is nice - what would be the next steps to making this tool serviceable.	12/8/2015 13:11	668		
Student83	Student65	1	"The presentation did a good job both explaining what the tool is for and what it does, and then showing how it works. A poten[firstname]l improvement would be to combine the two - talking about the features of the tool and how it works during a live demonstration, rather than using a power point. The tool itself looks great, nice work."	12/8/2015 12:59	689	7	
Student83	Student17	1	"Looks great. I like the concept of combining more of the communication channels we use in the OMS into a single platform for consistency and better overall UX. One concern I have looking at the demo is scalability of the number of discussion topics. Is there some filtering available, or other mechanisms to handle large volumes of topics? Overall nicely done."	12/10/2015 9:37	678		
Student83	Student14	1	This looks like great research. My only complaint about the video is that the slides moved pretty fast and I had to pause a few times to take in the graphs. Would you be willing to share your paper with the class? I think it would be very valuable to see the outcomes/conclusions of your research.	12/10/2015 11:19	385		
Student83	Student98	1	Great presentation. The platform you've developed looks very useful and has great functionality. The interface has a good level of polish. Nice work overall.	12/10/2015 11:26	1783	6	
Student67	Student81	1	Great presentation [firstname]. I think the poten[firstname]l of mixed reality for distance learning is yet to be seen but we can imagine how it might work. Great job on touching many of the aspects of the virtual world.	12/8/2015 13:23	2321	6	
Student67	Student37	1	"Great job! Very impressive work. I really like the clean and easy to use design of this portal. I am wondering about the ""learning content"" in the education section, will that content also be generated by the user community? Overall, great presentation!"	12/8/2015 14:08	10193		
Student67	Student92	1	Very interesting project. I like the fact that it is a platform for other developers to built their apps on and that you provide dynamic answers as users submit their code. Nice job!	12/10/2015 16:03	1547		
Student67	Student49	1	"I think I was provided a duplicate of your project for review, here is the feedback that I gave: ""Great job! Very impressive work. I really like the clean and easy to use design of this portal. I am wondering about the ""learning content"" in the education section, will that content also be generated by the user community? Overall, great presentation!"""	12/10/2015 16:31	99		
Student12	Student41	1	I really like being able to ask questions directly and receiving a response on your phone. I frequently have questions for the teacher and your project makes that simple and more direct than Piazza. Great job!!	12/8/2015 14:05	432		
Student12	Student82	2	"This is a great way to test the quality of your essay and get feedback. I think a good plus here would be able to see the rubric that's being put against the essay. This way, you know if the scoring is accurate or if it's using an outdated rubric."	12/8/2015 14:12	447	6	
Student12	Student44	1	You found great information on your topic and I found it very interesting. I think it would have been better if you spoke the entire time but overall the presentation looked great with very interesting information.	12/8/2015 14:23	97		
Student12	Student46	1	I like your approach on learning binary numbers. I struggled to understan[lastname]g the binary system and I feel this tool would have helped me. Great job!	12/8/2015 14:25	167	6	
Student64	Student40	2	"Wow [firstname], you really put a lot into this project and got a lot accomplished this semester. What you have done so far looks great."	12/8/2015 14:50	130		
Student64	Student34	1	Good research that you have developed. I would be interested to see if anyone expounds upon this next semester and compares the results that you came up with.	12/8/2015 14:53	550		
Student64	Student74	1	Good project presentation. Very detailed walkthrough and cool tool!	12/8/2015 15:02	573		
Student64	Student101	1	"Good project concept. However, I would like to have seen more of the results from the data collected and your takeaways from your research."	12/8/2015 15:12	536		
Student21	Student14	1	Nice. Lots of interesting data.	12/8/2015 21:06	36

Student76	Student95	2	"That was AWESOME! I love what you did with the Adafruit arduino. I personally love Raspberry Pis - but the pibot is still pricey compared to this (and heavier as well). I would be interested in seeing what you can do with different inputs (like CV libs with a camera, for instance). Very good realization of your project! Student76reene Student76"	12/8/2015 19:02	10565		
Student76	Student29	1	"The video was a great introduction, however I would like to have had a link to your final submission as most of the data seemed to be contained the[lastname]. This fit the research mold very nicely - I hope you plan to continue to publish your fin[lastname]gs! Student76reene, Student76"	12/8/2015 21:59	339		
Student76	Student7	2	"Very nice presentation and project completion goal satisfaction! I love the Swift playground and think it is a pretty awesome framework to use for teaching the way you do. How much more work is needed to complete this, or is it an ongoing effort? Student76reene"	12/8/2015 22:10	390		
Student76	Student13	1	"Regression trees and random forests! I LOVE IT! Great topic - determining when a student needs intervention is such a varied and important subject, particularly when there isn't supervision and the student can so easily be on an island (like in OMSCS)!"	12/10/2015 21:52	166		
Student71	Student55	2	"This would be a very helpful application for planning and scheduling. I agree with expan[lastname]g to include connecting students such as study groups. It could be as simple as sharing available times and means (such as ""Google Hangouts is my preferred meeting tool, my gmail is-------"")."	12/8/2015 22:39	587		
Student71	Student66	1	"I like the concept of making a game of co[lastname]g. I'm not sure how many different types of problems you have but can imagine the very simple like the demo to a more complex concept like inheritance. For example, you could have a boat class and then a sailboat class that inherits from boat or a motor boat class that inherits from boat, etc... neat stuff."	12/8/2015 23:02	398		
Student71	Student54	1	Like the idea and the application. Just not sure how plagiarism probability is calculated. Would be nice if how that is defined had been included in the video.	12/10/2015 19:15	99		
Student71	Student58	1	Fantastic work guys. It has been a pleasure being in this program with you.	12/10/2015 19:22	38		
Student81	Student43	2	very interesting concept. I can see how this can be applied to a wide variety of learning tasks..	12/9/2015 1:00	43		
Student81	Student9	1	good research. well explained.	12/9/2015 1:00	139	2

Student81	Student70	2	very mature product for a short time. great job	12/9/2015 1:06	151		
Student33	Student94	1	Excellent Project. I see how you guys combined the research with the action html drag and drop based application. It would definitely be a great tool to implement in elementary classrooms with a few different shapes and sizes. Sort of the puzzle based concept. Probably would be great to add a timer so as to see how the students improve with recognition on levels based on their times.	12/9/2015 6:22	193		
Student33	Student51	2	"Well done, This was a great presentation. It seems like a very interesting application. If you were to take the computation Photography class there may be some material covered in that course that you may have found helpful. But I found your presentation to be overall engaging and the concept of the app to be very well thought and the execution was wel done"	12/9/2015 17:28	119		
Student33	Student35	0	"Cool Tool. I see how you have implemented it with GitHub and it calculates based on commits and activity. Now does this just check co[lastname]g or does it check anything else. Usually in group projects there are word documents also and read me saves. Will it cover those. Other than that, this was a really good tool. Just had those questions."	12/10/2015 22:51	238		
Student33	Student16	2	Cool I get the concept. The traditional saying is that you either learn by repetition or [lastname]forcement. Great to see your tool is an innovative way of addressing the learning issue. Well done.	12/10/2015 22:56	73		
Student72	Student44	1	"Good job on your study and fin[lastname]gs. I believe you have produced a body of work that could be helpful in gui[lastname]g colleges in developing support for at-risk (i.e. full-time job, family) students, as well as encouragement to the software development community to consider student support app development targeting one of the under-served areas from you fin[lastname]gs. Thumbs up!"	12/9/2015 9:29	688		
Student72	Student85	1	"Nice project. I really liked how the educator can easily review student progress and see their answers. Overall, this seems to be more of a testing app than a learning app. Ad[lastname]g the ability to start with a lesson, following by the clip of the educator demonstrating what to do before jumping into the testing would create round out the app I believe."	12/9/2015 9:41	1694		
Student72	Student12	1	Good job on your project. Wish this resource had been available when I start OMSCS. Look forward to contributing to content.	12/9/2015 10:14	90		
Student72	Student82	0	"I really wanted to say it meets my expectations, but I feel I needed more on what the app is doing to compare my doc to the others in the database. And what is the value of the score. I mean does it indicate what score I might get when I submit it. Also, I would have liked to see the source code. Good idea, just need to see more it."	12/9/2015 10:23	256	2	It's pretty clear in the presentation what the various scores represent.
Student63	Student20	1	This project provides a better interaction between colleagues. The user interface is clear and is easy to use. The sussess story is a great idea which can provide people example to build their own idea and overcom issues. It is a nice feature that people can use it on any type of devices. This can help on increasing the time people spend on this app and provide better outcome. I think the project goals were achieved. Well done.	12/9/2015 11:45	1845		
Student63	Student8	1	I like the author link the social story to the game. Both positive and negative feedback can teach students the concept of given social story. The game interface is playful. Different level of the game can keep students engage with the story. The only thing I concern is the background music. It is too sad for playing the game. Overall I think the goal of this project is achieved. Good job.	12/9/2015 12:16	838		
Student63	Student32	1	"This app is very useful for both teacher and students. For teachers, It provides an easy environment to manage the content of course. It also provides a better communication between teachers and students. It would be better that author can give more explanation on the app demonstration. This will help people to understand the purpose of each step. I thin the app has many good features and the goal of the project is well delivered. Great job."	12/9/2015 12:50	459		
Student63	Student99	1	The author is developing a tool to recognize plagiarism problem in student's writing document. It is very interesting to know how to calculate the similarity of two essays to identify plagiarism by using simple math. This presentation is very clear. I think the goal of this project is achieved.	12/9/2015 13:07	388		
Student8	Student11	2	"This is great. I love how it points directly to a point so that we can really get the context we need for it. Being able to star things, login, or do it anonymously is amazing. Clicking on the time also makes that even easier. I agree that the communication can be great. its much better than just saying hey go to this one point in time. I feel its a better way to go about it. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised at all if Udacity contacts you and is like, hey, heres money, develop this for us or something as its a great addition."	12/9/2015 12:54	103		
Student8	Student32	2	I feel like this is a tool that I wouldn't really understand its full poten[firstname]l until I use it. Seems like a lot of features were added that seem to be of use. Creating things seems to be a breeze. It seemed to all flow well. The quizzes seem to also be done well. I would have loved something like this to help along with my AP classes.	12/9/2015 12:56	641		
Student8	Student99	2	"Sounds like others were not feeling well during their presentation..haha. After I did mine I felt like trash. I would love to see this work in action to see how mine rate...although that maybe more for the dale rating to see how readable mine are..haha. Either way, I like what I see. I could see this being automated in some way down the road to assist teachers."	12/9/2015 13:07	726	7	
Student8	Student20	2	"This seems like a LOT of work done. There is a lot to go through. Issues, nice view depen[lastname]g on the size of window. Just many things to look at. I think I would have to use it to really really understand..however, I will try not crash your plex server..haha."	12/9/2015 13:20	1517		
Student46	Student10	2	Looks great! It definitely looks complete and usable. Time to learn Chinese :)	12/9/2015 13:15	117		
Student46	Student84	2	Very interesting idea. The UI looked very clean and colorful. Overall it looks like you completed your project and have delivered something usable. Good job!	12/9/2015 13:17	141		
Student46	Student90	2	This was a very interesting project. I learned quite a bit just by watching the trailer for it. I'm not sure I saw someone actually using your project in the video. It would have been very helpful for someone to pretend to be the user and display the running application. If you did show the actual application it wasn't clear to me as a viewer.	12/10/2015 20:06	274	7	
Student46	Student41	2	Interesting project. It seemed like a more structured and moderated forum board.	12/10/2015 20:15	17		
Student54	Student61	1	"Interesting use of Treehouse API. A ""grader level"" is interesting. I can see this used as a way to evaluate if the work I did in Treehouse was effective. I think the design aspect of your project (especially web based) could be improved but inclu[lastname]g [lastname]trap (http://get[lastname]trap.com/). But I understand that doing so isn't the core part of this course."	12/9/2015 13:26	608		
Student54	Student55	1	"Out of everything I saw in the video, the auto chooser in the beginning was the most interesting (at least to me). The concept would be an interesting mobile app. An aside thought... It could be really useful to have this tool available alongside class enrollment info during registration weeks. Nice presentation! Well done."	12/9/2015 13:40	136		
Student54	Student18	1	"A simple survey creator could be very helpful for certain aspects of the OMS program. I like the array of [lastname] faces. Also, I like your choice of implementation technologies."	12/9/2015 13:42	158		
Student54	Student93	1	"I liked the pinky and the brain images. And wakefulness is an interesting issue. I think this along with some way to sense environmental factors would be interesting data to correlate. I'm pretty sure every college student will have an issue with their sleep patterns which could effect their writing. Interesting way to analyze the data too. Well done. I only wish that the video had a voice over to help explain parts of the project, rather than just a slide show presentation as a video."	12/9/2015 13:45	244		
Student91	Student83	1	"Looks like a good way of learning, Each time you would like to do something you need to solve some problem. The implementation of this idea in a game and the [lastname]forcement interaction is a good complement. Good Work!"	12/9/2015 13:39	109		
Student91	Student44	1	Seams like you got the objectives of your research. Good work.	12/12/2015 21:57	1728		
Student91	Student94	2	"Excellent presentation, Interesting project."	12/12/2015 23:01	280		
Student91	Student29	2	Very Nice presentation. Looks like you made great conclusions and confirmations of understan[lastname]gs we sometimes just assume they are that way. Good work!	12/12/2015 23:12	398		
Student43	Student29	1	Good video and interesting project. I don't have much to provide feedback on but I would have been interested in hearing more about the learning differences between age groups.	12/9/2015 15:29	840	5	
Student43	Student48	0	Document doesn't have any link or other content. So nothing for me to provide feedback on.	12/9/2015 15:45	38		
Student43	Student76	1	Great job! Looks like you put in a lot of effort on this and I definitely see it being useful for educators. I think you should continue your work on this.	12/9/2015 15:45	892		
Student43	Student95	2	Awesome! Looks like you've put in a lot of time and effort on these robots and I bet your students love buil[lastname]g these. I may try to build one of these myself :)	12/9/2015 16:00	640		
Student41	Student28	2	"This is a beautifully done application that I really hope gets integrated with the GaTech authentication schema so that we can all begin using this. I hope you don't mind that I created an account and added a review. I did notice that the tab at the top with my name (after I logged in) didn't do anything. Perhaps that hasn't been built out yet. One of the things that I particularly like is the skills feature that associates skills with classes. I noticed that you allow posts for the skills, which is a great way to students to share resources designed to sharpen those skills. It would be great to know what books, courses, tutorials, etc. would be valuable to go through before taking a particular class. Great contribution to the OMSCS community. I really hope that it lives on beyond this semester. Thank you."	12/9/2015 15:52	3199	6	
Student41	Student10	1	"This looks like a great tool for that intermediate stage of learning Chinese. I wish that I had the ability to try it, but I was unable to derive a web address. From an andragogical perspective, it sounds like it's the mix of familiar and unfamiliar words that makes this an effective tool. As a learner, I wonder how you would go about picking the language that you want to make into a document in your application. Is it a matter of fin[lastname]g a passage that is mostly understood so that you can import it and ""fill in the gaps?"" Is it as easy as copying and pasting into your application? It would have been nice to see a working example. Also, what's the order of ad[lastname]g the vocabulary to your application? Would you add a document first and then add vocabulary terms as you're familiar with them? Or, would you add the vocabulary before you begin working with the documents? Is there any ""preloaded"" vocabulary or documents based on a beginner's level knowledge of Chinese? Have you considered ad[lastname]g assessment functionality to test the learner's established vocabulary? I guess I just have a lot of questions related to the full cycle of using your application to advance your learning. That's definitely not a criticism. Lots of possibilities with this application. I hope that you continue to develop it as it sounds like there's really a [firstname]et for such a tool."	12/9/2015 16:56	1550		
Student41	Student84	1	"As the parent of a 9-month-old, I could envision an app like this getting some significant use in my house. I say ""app"" because I believe that a mobile app might be the best delivery for this concept as it's a lot more likely that I'll be able to look at my phone than a computer when I'm babysitting. In terms of UX, I think some additional labeling might be really helpful. Ad[lastname]g ""months"" after ""6,"" for example, would probably keep things from getting confusing. The charts in the final section of the video would likely benefit from some additional labeling, too. An app like this could be a big seller, as it would not only be a repository for parents to know what the milestones are, but a simple way for them to track progress, too. An app could include reminders on birthdays to fill in the current information, see people in nearby geographical regions, etc. Cool idea and one that could definitely see a lot of traction. Good job!"	12/9/2015 17:36	407		
Student41	Student90	0	"Having already watched the trailer for a previous peer review, this was the same video that I previously viewed. It would have been nice to see what progress you've made since the trailer was developed, see it working as an application, etc. I still think this is a great concept and a worthy pursuit, but I would have liked to see more of the final product instead of watching the trailer again."	12/9/2015 17:43	1366	4	
Student7	Student66	1	"Your presentation did a good job describing your project's goals and architecture. Not requiring students to install Java or another programming language is an important feature of your project. It is often difficult to get a programming environment set up, so sparing your students from that process will make it easier for them to learn. Are there any security concerns about running any code the user submits on your server?"	12/9/2015 17:56	715		
Student7	Student71	1	"I enjoyed watching the demo of your app. I am an iOS developer, so it was interesting for me to see what you have built. Did anyone on your team have any iOS development experience before the project? I know it is not easy to get started with iOS development. It is an impressive achievement to have built a working application during the semester. Congratulations."	12/9/2015 18:20	764	6	"This was good. To answer Ben's question, I think only one member of our team, [firstname], had any experience with iOS development. Not positive on [firstname] but I certainly did not have any. It has been fun learning and need to learn more as we intend to keep pursuing the app."
Student7	Student13	1	Congratulations on writing a paper suitable for publication. It sounds like you had some interesting fin[lastname]gs about predictors for success in the KBAI course. Maybe some of your fin[lastname]gs will influence the way OMSCS courses are taught in the future.	12/9/2015 18:33	596		
Student7	Student53	1	I enjoyed your presentation. You made an impressive and polished tool. I liked that you support both English and Spanish. Do you have plans to [firstname]et your project and try to get it into schools?	12/9/2015 18:48	1280		
Student4	Student92	1	"Hi [firstname], I downloaded the file from T-Square but was not able to open using Window Media Player. Good luck with your project! Regards, [lastname]"	12/9/2015 20:05	447		
Student4	Student100	2	"Really nice work. I am amazed at the level of progress you have been able to achieve with the project. I am a teacher myself and would love to use this tool. Looking forward to use once you guys release the first version of the project. Best Regards, [lastname] (Student4 )"	12/9/2015 20:23	428		
Student4	Student67	2	It is an amazing concept. Wishing you all the best in your attempt to influence student's life in the right direction	12/9/2015 20:39	119	5	
Student4	Student49	2	Great Idea! It is amazing to see the progress you have been able to make. Good luck!	12/9/2015 20:51	41		
Student99	Student11	1	Great idea. Looks like it works pretty well--one additional feature I can think of would be to have the tool email you if someone responded to something you posted. Thanks!	12/9/2015 20:32	10		
Student99	Student20	1	"Hi Team Krash, Cool project. It took me a little bit to figure out what it had to do with EdTech, but I think it really hits on a cool piece of education: not just about downloa[lastname]g information, but education is also about thinking of good questions for deep understan[lastname]g and interacting with people to dive into those deeper questions. I think this project could be really useful for engaging people in that sort of learning and innovation process (with proper buy-in from management in a corporate setting I would think). Thanks!"	12/9/2015 20:32	160		
Student99	Student86	1	"Interesting project--neat idea to teach the same curriculum across multiple age groups. It wasn't clear how you arrived at some of your results (I'd probably have to read the papers to understand that), such as conclu[lastname]g that humor was effective in helping people learn (was there a control group in which you were very boring?). All in all, great project. Thanks for sharing!"	12/9/2015 20:35	500		
Student99	Student59	1	"Hi [firstname], Interesting project. What readability metric did you use to classify texts (I worked on a plagiarism detection tool this semester that used the Dale-Chall readability metric as an input variable)? Thanks!"	12/9/2015 20:43	308		
Student42	Student50	1	"Great job on the presentation [firstname], and the insights to the program were very interesting. I know from past research efforts it can be frustrating to get the level of participation in surveys or cooperation from actual record-keepers. Nonetheless, the demographic information is an accomplishment in and of itself, good work."	12/9/2015 21:14	181		
Student42	Student88	1	"Josh, I enjoyed the presentation and really enjoyed the tool. I think it could provide a valuable service to students attempting to plan out their limited time and resources from term to term. Well done."	12/9/2015 21:24	80		
Student42	Student22	1	"I've always thought of pursuing training as an educator perhaps as a second career in the future, and I will remember this study when I do. The varying aptitudes of different age groups was of particular interest, and I will know in the future to take this into account before I embark upon any career as a computer science educator."	12/10/2015 10:30	156		
Student42	Student39	1	"I also reviewed this project during the proposal phase and was interested in it then, and the results in the final presentation are very compelling. I think the work done here will have a significant positive impact, well done!"	12/10/2015 11:03	137		
Student100	Student37	1	"Pretty cool and well executed. I think I needed to read the proposal and/or project paper to fully understand the premise here. I get that ideas are matched with issues. I don't quite get the employee training part. Or rather, I don't really understand why/how they are connected with the ideation bit. Would the idea eventually be to match problem with idea with solution developer (thus the tracking of employees)? Anyway, great work. Glad I got to see it."	12/9/2015 21:15	954		
Student100	Student67	1	"I didn't get a complete feel for how the system would work from the video, though. How is content submitted/rated/vetted/etc? I think you discussed user ratings, but how is the content aggregated to start with? This is an app that would also benefit from a social tie-in, as well. Not a new social network, but a connection to an existing social graph like Facebook's (did I have any friends or friends-of-friends who rated this so I can get a real inside scoop?). Overall a good looking system which seems to make strides towards solving a real issue."	12/9/2015 21:31	620	6	
Student100	Student49	1	Hmm. Got assigned this twice. Won't bore you with a second review. Well done! :)	12/9/2015 21:42	63		
Student100	Student92	1	Looks to be a good start at an adaptive intelligent tutoring system. Cool core architecture. Lots of poten[firstname]l. I'll definitely keep my eyes open for a feature complete version of this hitting the net soon!	12/9/2015 21:43	624

Student53	Student71	1	"Nice demo, my only feedback would be to have added a small intro on what is video modeling. I hadn't run into your progress in previous peer feedbacks so this was the first time I saw it, I therefore had to google what was video modeling about to get a better idea. Pretty cool concept to create a framework to facilitate this."	12/9/2015 22:16	250	6	Good feedback as video modeling was the ini[firstname]l impetus for the application.
Student53	Student66	1	"Very nice presentation. I think you put a pretty good demo of the foundations of what this app will become. The game sequence looked very good, and saving all those stats such as keystrokes and time will server in the long run to further enhance the app and learning. My only question would be when the teacher got asked for feedback he didn't see the grid with the game, how would he know what kind of feedback to provide? (maybe I missed something here). PS: Happy Holidays to you too!"	12/9/2015 22:30	242		
Student53	Student58	1	"Had seen the trailer for the previous peer feedback, so knew what this was about. Looking forward to the paper. Where and when will we be able to see it?"	12/9/2015 22:34	343		
Student53	Student54	1	"Looks good, liked the look and feel, looks very easy to use. Only feedback would be to have added some explanations on how the plagiarism is detected."	12/9/2015 22:40	490		
Student2	Student12	1	"NIce! I think the biggest complement that I can give is that I think iReady's genuinely useful and I may use it for registration in the future! Someone else in the class developed a scheduling application to help you plan semesters. If you could combine iReady's information on a course (and possibly extend it to include syllabi from the OMSCS courses page) I can't see anyone not using that tool. It'd be insanely useful, not that what you have isn't already awesome. Great job, I hope you'll be continuing work and keep us updated! [firstname]"	12/9/2015 23:27	145		
Student2	Student75	1	"Nice work! I think you've put together a really solid application in terms of construction and interface. I'm not 100% clear on the use case, perhaps a story about why someone might use it would be helpful. Will you be continuing development, or making the tool publicly available? Make sure to keep the class posted if so! [firstname]"	12/9/2015 23:29	622		
Student2	Student72	1	"Cool! Very cool to see a project that's research enabled by tool development (the only I've reviewed). I think the application itself is very clean and well designed. I can definitely envision young kids having a blast with it on an iPad. I bet they didn't even realize they were learning! ;-) More data would have been nice (it's a little difficult to make statements as to trends/statistics when you have such a small sample size), but I understand how difficult it must be to do user testing for something like this. If you plan on publishing your results elsewhere, I'd certainly make an acknowledgment as to the small sample size if you're going to comment on trends in the data. Great work!

Student2	Student85	1	"It's not the flashiest tool I've seen so far, but I think it's the best designed and developed. Really nice job [firstname]. You've made something clean, full featured, and extensible. Because of the nature of the application, I think a logical next step would be a UI tune up, but your infrastructure appears to be really excellent. Are you in talks with any educators or administrators about beta testing the tool? I would love to see how an implementation progressed. [firstname]"	12/9/2015 23:50	686

Student34	Student8	1	"You came a long way in one semester, and I really like how you tied in research about how children with autism may think to try to suit the game to them. I found myself not expecting your sprite to be able to just walk past the others because of the 2D setting and somehow I was thinking that whole level would be about having to jump over but never on them, and I'm a little curious if that's just an intuition I picked up from games I've played or if it's the reaction other people would have in the 2D setting as well."	12/10/2015 5:47	91		
Student34	Student63	1	I remember watching your trailer! I really like the idea of having equations and then comparing them against what a simulation does to build some intuition. You did amazing work for one semester!	12/10/2015 5:51	27

I think we have mismatched expectations about what the presentation was supposed to be."	12/10/2015 5:58	72	7	
Student34	Student74	0	"I think the project looks impressive, but I found the presentation difficult to follow. I don't understand video modeling as well as you do, and I think it would have been a great deal more clear to me if you had walked through the use of the app as it's intended to happen, creating a student, making a short modeling scenario, and showing what the experience is supposed to look like while provi[lastname]g some information to frame it and give a sense of why it's useful and what it should be able to achieve when it's 100% done. This felt more like a feature list that was intended for someone who already has a lot of expertise in this area."	12/10/2015 6:05	139

Student44	Student41	1	"This concept resonates w/ me b/c I have the same basic concept but applied it in a different [firstname]et segment. My idea was to go to retirement communities and have people register their skills/expertise in a database along w/ their contact information and availability. This concept is particularly susceptible to a global deployment. Then if someone needs a rocket scientist at 3PM today, they simply search the database and connect w/ one via telephone, text, video chat, etc. that is available at the time they need them. You applied a similar concept in an online training environment. Nice job. I also found and watch your online trailer. That was also well done. Glad you had a chance to use a class to work on and mature a concept that you've had in your head for some time. That is a great thing. It also frees up your head space for more ideas. Good luck w/ it in the future."	12/10/2015 7:55	405		
Student44	Student84	1	Interesting. I can see the utility in this application. Could also see that expan[lastname]g it to generate graphs and other visualizations of a child's progress compared w/ others would be powerful. Nice job!	12/10/2015 8:14	56		
Student92	Student3	1	"Lucus, this was a great demo. I think this definitely meets a growing need. I expect k-12 education to lean more heavily on technology, and especially the vast resources of the Internet. I helped out with IT in my high school, so I remember how difficult it was to connect and manage all those devices. My only suggestion would be in regards to the audio. The sound is quite a bit muffled in parts. Otherwise, terrific job! I hope that you continue with this project outside of this course."	12/10/2015 9:05	114	6

Student36	Student87	1	"Good presentation! I didn't have any issues with hearing you from my speakers. I would recommend trying to speak closer to your mic in the future, but it was fine for this submission."	12/10/2015 12:31	56		
Student36	Student1	1	"Great research topic and fin[lastname]gs! I particularly like that your idea could help close the gap between high school and online learning experiences. Keep at it, I hope you continue work on this or get it published!"	12/10/2015 12:32	275	7	
Student36	Student78	1	"Great presentation! Your UI is organized in a way that is easy to use. My one question is, for more complex problems, how would you support the symbols and notations needed? I would recommend looking at the use of symbols by wolfram alpha for steps on how to do this. Keep up the good work!"	12/10/2015 12:36	157		
Student95	Student53	2	You did a fantastic job on this project! I can see many places where an app like this would be very useful. I hope it turns into a real world project that gets used everywhere. Great job!	12/10/2015 16:34	127		
Student95	Student29	2	"Nice job on your video. I teach middle school computers and robots, so I know the benefits of humor in keeping kids attention. I also try to avoid the Bueler syndrome. I look forward to readying your paper."	12/10/2015 16:36	436		
Student95	Student7	2	"Wow, this is very detailed. A few years ago I took a crack at programming IOS but did not get very far. I just could not get over the ini[firstname]l learning curve. Your curriculum looks like just what I needed. On course, now I have to go find a mac so I can play. Great Job! OMSCS needs a mobile devices programming class."	12/10/2015 16:44	774		
Student95	Student13	2	Very useful information you are discovering. I am looking forward to rea[lastname]g your paper. I too have found that piazza most definitely adds to the OMSCS experience. Classes where Piazza was not as active were not nearly as engaging. Congratulations on graduation!	12/10/2015 16:57	454		
Student84	Student73	1	job well done. This I'm sure will become a handy tool for the OMSCS advisers to refer new students to so that they can decide on what they're going to be taking in the coming semesters and plan out their degree. good job.	12/10/2015 16:36	140		
Student84	Student90	1	"very interesting. I hope you keep developing your project further. I wasn't aware of this even though I do have a young toddler. So I'll keep my eyes open and will try the rhythm method you used in your tool on my son, maybe I can use it to teach him some math stuff even before he's 5. Great job. Thanks"	12/10/2015 16:39	782	7	
Student84	Student28	1	well done. I'm gonna be using this tool. I'm really grateful that we had this class to build a tool like this. I've been using the excel sheet that has been shared through the google plus community. I hope this gets some good traction. Maybe if you share it on github and get an active community behind it and later on start asking for donations to keep the site up and running on that same server. I think you may be able to get some fun[lastname]g from fellow students to keep the site up and free for everyone. great job team.	12/10/2015 16:53	291	7	
Student84	Student10	2	Looks good. It shows you worked hard on it. I did feel that it was a little hard for me to get started with the tool. I think if you had a step by step walk through of a sample where a first time user with zero language knowledge would want to begin using the tool could follow and begin using it. The tool was well structured and I see you have made great progress on getting it to a usable prototype. Well done.	12/10/2015 16:58	594		
Student47	Student39	1	Cool app!! I thought the UI/UX was well though out. The ability to be able to provide feedback/hints to the student is great (similiar to udacity quizes). The analytics and student performance tracking sounds pretty innovative. The only thing I would have liked to see as a feature is the ability for teachers to export assessments and share that to other teachers so they can import the same assessments into their smarter ap deployment. You probably imagined this to be a take-home quiz thing but I actually think it would be a better fit for in-class assignments/quizzes as well - maybe when all students have ipads or tablets! Great job.	12/10/2015 17:03	620		
Student47	Student25	0	"Very informative presentation! I especially liked learning about docker, I wasn't familiar with that technology, but I'm not surprised it scored the lowest. You mentioned over time, containers will start to become more popular when use cases are discovered. What is that time frame? How long did it take for these other Virtual solutions to grow to where they are now?"	12/10/2015 17:15	296		
Student47	Student42	1	"Very cool! I like that you built out support for multiple languages. I played around with the app and it was fun. I would have liked some sort of difficulty level/progression feature. for example, start off with 2 words, then 3, then 4 and so on. I also think it would be interesting if as it gets more difficult, the sentences start having multiple blanks and the student has to pick 2 words instead of 1. This was great for the limited amount of time we had in the class."	12/10/2015 17:20	372		
Student47	Student88	1	"I remember watching your trailer and liked it just because I thought it was such a unique tool (and I still do). Glad to see the final product. The only thing I would recommend is having a label besides each node that shows how many child nodes it has. This way, you can see how large a lesson is compared to other lessons without having to expand. It's also interesting you show a screencap from google analytics...this reminded me of Goal Flows in GA (shows how visitors move through your site to get to a specific webpage)."	12/10/2015 17:27	774		
Student45	Student19	1	"I wanted to participate in Hour of code and teach kids programming basics, your tool seems very effective for that. I actually ended up using something very very similar to this game on minecraft website. https://studio.code.org/s/mc/stage/1/puzzle/1 It good exercise for Day 1 but I though I could have taught them something a bit more complex than this. Hence, I have planned another exercise for next week which will be HTML. I am excited to see if students will find it too tough."	12/10/2015 18:39	214	6	
Student45	Student26	2	"It is a very useful tool, specially for a program like ours where the number of students is much more than a traditional classroom setup. However I am wondering if this tool is going to be applicable to report type submissions. Overall, great work!"	12/11/2015 23:45	291		
Student45	Student96	2	Great work! Really neat dashboard and I really love the overall application features. I look forward to utilizing this project one day.	12/11/2015 23:56	95	6	
Student45	Student80	1	I played the game and every time I disagreed my score dropped. Not sure I fully understood your project's intent but it's an excellent presentation!	12/11/2015 23:57	367		
Student32	Student86	1	"Hello EMOT Team, Very interesting high-level overview of what the EMOT team has accomplished during this semester. Once the paper becomes available I'll be sure to seek it about to gain more insight and details into your research and finds! Great work and enjoy your break! =[firstname] ="	12/10/2015 18:56	498		
Student32	Student99	1	"Hi [firstname], What a fantastic tool! The ability to leverage the Dale-Chall Readability Formula and the Cosine Similarity measurement is genius! The first formula establishes the baseline readability level of the writer and the second measure the similarity measurement between known pattern measurements and the unknown document. The tool seems intuitive to use where the teacher would have a very small, if any, learning curve. Excellent work! I'm curious what plans you have with the tools going forward? I wonder, for example, if you're thinking of maintaining a student database where the writer's scores can be stored and used perpetually while they're still enrolled in the school. Furthermore, was curious if, once the unknown document has been validated, they new scores would be aggregated into the previous scores; for example as the writer's readability score improves over time. Just food for thought. Congratulations on your terrific work this semester [firstname]! Enjoy your break, Student32"	12/10/2015 20:53	753		
Student32	Student20	2	"Hi Team Krash Override, Fantastic final presentation! Loved the layout of the EmPower Portal App. In fact, I've logged in as pm498m and made some submissions, inclu[lastname]g an invention! Maybe for the next project you guys do, you can create that invention ;-) EmPower is a fantastic idea and it wonderful that you have successfully created a working prototype, I hope this project gets real traction and you'll be to implement this into your company. = [firstname] ="	12/10/2015 21:18	781		
Student32	Student11	1	"Hi Vu, This is a terrific add-on and, what I believe, would be a very practical and useful tool that could be used in our Udacity courses. The only question that I do have in mind is whether or not a comment or a thread (e.g. an inappropriate thread) could be removed by an authorized moderator? Also, one more question, would the submitter be able to remove their own comments, questions, or replies? Just a thought? Terrific job and enjoy the break -- see ya next semester = [firstname] ="	12/10/2015 21:31	833		
Student60	Student83	1	I really liked your presentation. The idea of challenge via a game is awesome. Keep up the good work.	12/10/2015 20:39	61		
Student60	Student52	1	Nice fin[lastname]gs from research. Much needed research topic to keep up education with technology.	12/11/2015 10:57	68	6	
Student60	Student21	1	Much needed application for OMSCS. Keep up the good work. Kudos!	12/11/2015 10:59	75

Student59	Student78	1	"Unfortunately, your video would not play correctly for me despite trying a few different apps. However, I was able to listen to the audio and get some idea of what you were doing. It sounds like you have a nice, complete workflow, though I really wish I was able to say more. I'm using Ubuntu 14, and tried the built-in video app as well as VLC. Guessing a Windows machine would have handled this better but I don't have access to one at the moment."	12/10/2015 21:49	323		
Student59	Student1	1	"Interesting set of features and a smooth presentation. While some of the features (SMS) were confusing to me, others are ones I would like to see in Udacity (integrated notes, questions for professor tied to content). Overall, nicely done and presented."	12/10/2015 21:55	474	7	
Student59	Student87	1	"Well done presentation. I know first hand how hard it is to demo a backend-only application, but your walkthrough of the annotated configuration code was nicely done, and easy enough to follow. Are you planning on continuing the project and ad[lastname]g the Django app? Would be interested to try this out myself, even though i think my courses through graduation are fairly set."	12/10/2015 22:03	548		
Student59	Student36	1	"Very well done presentation. However, I would really like to have seen a live demo of the application, or a link to a running version of the app. I think your ini[firstname]l research is interesting, and you definitely have your ""why"" set out well. The app looks good, as far as I can see. Will be interesting to see where this gets taken beyond this class!"	12/11/2015 17:10	803		
Student65	Student97	1	This was a project very well put together. It looks professional and clean. Very useful concept. Great work.	12/10/2015 22:41	33		
Student65	Student98	1	"Your work is very professionally put together. Looks like a very robust application. The only concern I had was that there seems to be a lot of personal data requested by the app, such as non-school related extra curricular activities and parent educational background. These items and others are privacy concerns, and would not be able to actually be used by a public school district."	12/10/2015 22:50	132	6	
Student65	Student14	1	This is a great topic for research. I would love to read your results and hear more about the conclusions.	12/10/2015 22:53	337		
Student65	Student17	1	This looks like it adds some nice features to the current functionality of Piazza and T Square.	12/10/2015 23:03	202		
Student73	Student34	1	"Really good presentation and fascinating data. One question I had was (haven't taken the class) could the problem be on the exam side, and not the homework side? Interesting to consider anyway. I think this study (and followups) could be extremely useful for improving the class if the professor is on board."	12/11/2015 10:09	99		
Student73	Student24	2	Great project! Are you moving forward with getting this integrated into any courses for OMSCS?	12/11/2015 10:13	21	6	"Thanks [firstname]. If given an opportunity, I would love to integrate with existing GaTech services and ultimately being utilized for a course trial."
Student73	Student64	1	"Nice work, good analysis of a big need in our educational system. Thanks also for introducing me to Tynker and Scratch - hadn't heard of those."	12/11/2015 10:19	30		
Student73	Student40	1	"Nice detailed setup instructions, looks like will be a cool product when finished"	12/11/2015 10:27	22		
Student101	Student63	1	"I like your project and believe it is a much needed application. The idea of using an interactive game to assist in teaching physics not just makes it fun for the student, but also is a very effective teaching methodology. I feel that an important factor which you included, is the concept and ability to allow the student to move at their own pace. I like your project and wish the the best with making it come to life!"	12/11/2015 13:11	981		
Student101	Student8	1	"First off, I think it is great to develop an application that is specifically for people that are either physically or mentally challenged. I like how it is simple, because sometimes I think if something appears to be too complex people tend to avoid it. I like the idea of a different level if having to start over so they cannot memorize it, reminds me of playing Super Mario B[lastname]ers on the original Nintendo - which you could memorize it. The only thing I may suggest is maybe add some text that comes up and states what is being vocalized. I do not know if that would be an issue or not with kids that have autism. Overall, I love it! I wish you the best with your further development of this game."	12/11/2015 13:28	1144		
Student101	Student32	2	Excellent presentation! The project looked excellent as well. Job well done.	12/11/2015 13:47	2944		
Student101	Student99	1	"Great prototype! At times in your presentation it was kind of hard to hear everything you were saying, like there was a constant static noise. Only other thing I advise for future presentations is to maybe add some colored indicators showing what exactly you are referring to on the screen, it would help the viewer to follow along. Looks like some promising work! Good job and I wish the best of luck to you."	12/11/2015 14:36	1210		
Student35	Student47	1	The presentation does a good job of outlining your research project. I like how you have used slides to discuss your project and wish I had also incorporated the same idea in my presentation. I look forward to rea[lastname]g the research paper.	12/11/2015 15:20	623		
Student35	Student68	1	Good job with the presentation. It describes the project well and provides a good summary of the fin[lastname]gs.	12/11/2015 15:37	48		
Student35	Student42	1	"Good effort, Team Vocab! The presentation provides a helpful walk through of how the application works. Inclu[lastname]g a link to the live application was a very good idea (I wish I had thought of the same when submitting my project presentation). I look forward to trying out the application itself and rea[lastname]g more about your project in the course library. Thanks!"	12/12/2015 20:28	150		
Student35	Student25	1	"The video provides a very good overview of different virtualization technologies. My only minor concern is that the presentation could have been condensed a little bit. Overall, the video demonstrates good effort in the project, and I look forward to rea[lastname]g more about the project in the course library. Thanks!"	12/12/2015 20:31	88		
Student25	Student22	1	"Great job team on your project! I wish I could of learned programming in Middle and High school growing up, but certainly looks like you have a good blueprint on teaching these concepts at an early age."	12/11/2015 16:43	11		
Student25	Student42	1	Great job SmarterAP team on your project! Very detailed outline of the system and features and enjoyed watching the system in action at the end to get a better idea of what it looks like!	12/11/2015 16:43	19		
Student25	Student88	1	Great job [firstname]! I completely agree with buil[lastname]g software and han[lastname]g it over just does not work. But with the system you built with provi[lastname]g a visual representation of what they are doing is a very effective approach. Nice work!	12/11/2015 16:44	16

Student26	Student33	1	"Hello Team Code Element, I think your final presentation was very thorough and you explained your research very clearly. The Israeli comparison was a nice touch. I remember reviewing your work earlier, if I remember correctly you had 3 members, thought my memory might be wrong here? When I read the project plan I thought you had a fascinating topic and I was looking forward to hearing your fin[lastname]gs, so it was very interesting to see your final presentation now. Since you had a purely research approach it was harder to take full advantage of the possibilities of video delivery; I think you could have included more charts and maybe you could film yourself rather than slides because I was not able to listen and read at the same time. This is not related to the content of your research at all, merely thinking of ways to make the delivery more engaging. I think you fin[lastname]gs demonstrated your learning throughout the semester and it appears you were able to complete the full project in time during the semester, which means your scope, plan and time management skills were spot on, good job! Thank you for you presentation I enjoyed watching it. Good luck in future semesters."	12/11/2015 17:34	1320		
Student26	Student96	1	"Hello [firstname], I was quite intrigued by your presentation since I'm a web developer by trade. This is the first time I am hearing about your project so bear with me if some of my questions already have been answered elsewhere. 1) I thought the Community of Practice aspect was interesting. I wasn't quite sure based on the presentation thought what the community of practice was, and how it is displayed in the control panel? I guess a better way of presenting this question would be to ask, how is your tool different given this community of practice aspect vs. if it did not have the community of practice background at all? 2) I wasn't sure what the educational aspect was, unless it related to the community of practice I mentioned earlier? 3) How is this tool different from cloud providers or having own physical hardware to run web servers? If I was a prospective user or angel investor, how would you sell this idea to me and convince me it's the one I should go with rather than the alternatives? Overall I think your tool looks good, you certainly have a lot of features and everything appears to be working correctly. Some of the design elements appear mixed unless that was on purpose. Overall your presentation was interesting and dynamic, and kept me engaged throughout. Thank you and good luck in future semesters."	12/11/2015 17:57	1091	7	
Student26	Student80	1	"I enjoyed watching your final presentation, it showcased very clearly what you had been working on and what your outputs were. That said, this was the first time I remember peer reviewing your work, so I felt like I did not have all the background information I wish I would have had to better understand the discussion you had about the different scores and game play. I am guessing this is the project where you were looking for people to play on piazza? How unfortunate you didn't get any synchronous game play. In case you still wanted to get people to play at the same time, maybe try posting a link that takes the user directly to the game on a live chat board. I am quite sure at least two people would click and try to play. I have a feeling your project was really fascinating, I wish I had a more detailed view of what it was. Your presentation was interesting to watch and I think if you get a chance you should go present it, Your enthusiasm for your work was obvious in your presentation."	12/11/2015 18:22	699		
Student26	Student19	2	"Hello [firstname], I enjoyed watching your final presentation. I think in your delivery, you were conscious of audience and the fact that not everyone would know the background of the project, so thank you for explaining everything from ground up. This was the first time I was reviewing your work, so it was very helpful. Overall I thought your delivery was very dynamic and engaging, and your message was clearly communicated. The game looks nice, actually it reminds me a lot about the games on code.org. I am quite certain that is because of the google library used to arrange the blocks. Also recognized the mario feel, I used to play it as a child too. The group tracking feature was a nice touch. I think one thing to consider there is to think of some way to make the url really short. If the game is for young children that link can be quite challenging if they need to be type it. Also maybe include some way to type in a name, similar to how some games prompt you for a player name, Then you could use that to display to the teacher and they would know what session belongs to which student. Thank you for sharing your code on github It is very interesting to me. I'm a developer too but I use .NET stack. Especially I was interested in the redis backend. since I've been meaning to try that out. I might look at your project as an example. Thank you for your presentation and good luck in future semesters."	12/11/2015 18:34	1211	7	
Student80	Student94	1	"Great results. Bringing code into the world is quite an adventure. I hope the feedback below helps you with next steps: clarity: At the beginning of the presentation I didn't understand if you were critiquing montessori or reviewing it. I still don't see the relationship between the shapes task and montessori, other than that you tested it in a montesori classroom. What difference would it have made if you had tested in a traditional classroom? That would be an interesting experiment. project thoughts: edge resistance and collision detection would be useful for your shapes. The principles of material design are my first thought. There are numerous packages that do collision detection in javascript, such as https://github.com/jriecken/sat-js paper.js looks pretty neat. I'll have to check it out. I used velocity.js in my project. It might be useful to you for cueing players about interface elements."	12/11/2015 18:36	291		
Student80	Student33	1	"This doesn't seem like the final presentation. It uses the future tense. I had trouble keeping track of the presentation at 15 minutes. At many times, the video was silent, so I wasn't sure if it was working. Why leave the slide sitting there if you are not talking, especially if the font is unreadable. Tightening it up would deliver the message more clearly. The fin[lastname]g about computer science being offered only to AP students is significant. How might you address that issue? Do you plan to continue to address it? Why were two of the bars blue but the rest red in the key fin[lastname]gs slide? Who considers Israel the ""start-up nation"" I'm curious what teacher pay is like in Israel."	12/11/2015 18:42	608		
Student80	Student51	1	"Going from the title slide to the work was sudden. I got lost and didn't know what the goal was. Did you use this tool to do your edtech final presentation video? Is the app for students or teachers? Is it to teach them to make videos, or is it to help them make videos from other subjects? Do you find that the workflow aids in video recor[lastname]g? ""Point and shoot"" tends to get in the way less, for me, and all the UI elements on my phone can make things confusing. Have you done testing to see how people react to your UI elements?"	12/11/2015 18:52	492		
Student80	Student16	1	"Pachylearn is a clever name, elephants and their memories. There was a low buzz in our video. That's probably AC current interfering with your mic. If you're on a laptop, running on battery while recor[lastname]g audio can help without having to buy new hardware. It wasn't too distracting, though. How effective is this tool today? I need to study for the GRE!! You said in the beginning that learning is no longer a matter of rote memorization. Do you think that's how education was? Are you referring to certain grade levels. How does your app escape rote memorization? It seems like more of a flashcard system as it is. I couldn't from the brief examples if you had incorporated timed feedback for enhanced memorization. What algorithm did you use? What steps would you take to make it adaptive? What's the alternative to memorization?"	12/11/2015 19:19	8610		
Student11	Student87	0	"I found myself wanting to know more about how the engine is selecting courses. I assume on it selects courses based upon self input ability and whether or not the course has already been taken, but does it also incorporate other things? Where does the machine learning come into play? On a side note, I would have put the user inputs in a separate text file rather than as part of the python script."	12/11/2015 22:32	638		
Student11	Student86	1	"Oh man, that Mayo clinic joke killed me. Haha. On a purely shallow level, I think the slides need some modernization. They look dated. Substance wise, I'd like to have found out more about the results of the study."	12/11/2015 22:43	534		
Student11	Student59	1	"In the beginning scenario where you're explaining the need, I got distracted trying to read the text on the slides. So I'd probably add an image slide before the text one. Good job explaining the need and what the project does. Really cool though. I found myself wanting to fast forward through the design portion just to see it in action because I was intrigued."	12/11/2015 22:52	337		
Student11	Student36	1	I would have liked to have learned more about the conclusions drawn from the research and how that influenced the feature design of My OLE. I thought it lacked some cohesion between the two segments and wasn't sure how the research tied to the web app.	12/11/2015 22:59	1077		
Student19	Student16	2	Awesome project!! I'm actually very interested to use something like Pachylearn myself.	12/11/2015 22:44	528		
Student19	Student80	1	Great work on your project! It's always nice when the data we get is totally unexpected. I don't have any background context on what you project scope is. It would have been good to see the game and the entire app with a bit more detail.	12/11/2015 22:53	368		
Student19	Student33	1	Amazing information. My project was related to computer science education for children and it certainly does seem as if early exposure sparks greater interest.	12/11/2015 22:59	408	7	
Student19	Student51	1	Great app! I love the editing interface. It seems very intuitive and easy to use (I certainly would have liked to used that for my final presentation!). The app looks amazing and very useful.	12/11/2015 23:06	988		
Student70	Student43	2	"Hi [firstname], Very nice project, specially since it was done just by you. I think it is a very good way to learn bar related stuff. But more than that, this is a very good teaching model, where students can learn in an interactive manner. I think this idea has a lot of applications out there. It remains me all these flight simulators, for instance. Is there any API or some way you can provide more drink recipes? that would be a great enhancement I think.

Student70	Student9	1	"Hi [firstname], Very interesting research project! it is good to see games from other perspectives and I can definitely see all these practice can lead to train or educate the player. When you were talking about the ""identity"" factor missing on some theories I immediately thought about the Wii system, which created an avatar for you, and I think you are right, you can feel a connection between you and the avatar playing the game. Nice Job!"	12/12/2015 13:45	1232		
Student70	Student3	1	"Hi [firstname], Very interesting research project! I think you are absolutely right the Vision is probably the biggest aspect, because with lack of vision the execution will almost certainly fail. My personal impression is that mobile devices are good for two years, in average, either because the battery is not lasting enough or because of performance, disk space, etc. So, what do you recommend in general? to renew the devices every two years or to try to extend the life as much as they can? Nice Job, really good video!"	12/12/2015 14:06	1156	6

Student17	Student97	1	"Your concept is ingenious. As a student who was previously an Information Security focus in my undergrad, something like this would have been extremely helpful. One of my major challenges as an InfoSec graduate, it wasn't clear what sort of material employers were looking for directly. It seems that your product clears that up by clearly linking employers and candidates. I can honestly say that I would have loved to have this while I was in undergrad or even shortly after I had graduated. Looking forward, I can see this product being reshaped for other fields outside of InfoSec as well, perhaps Software Development, DevOps, etc. Excellent job!"	12/12/2015 3:47	304		
Student17	Student45	1	"Great concept! I think that this is extremely helpful for incoming and current students. I know that I will certainly be looking to use iReady in this coming semester. I think that looking forward, you could even expand this application outside of OMSCS and into other university platforms. With a little tweaking, what's to say that you couldn't allow for open source community contribution for university catalog courses? Great job, excited to see how your project progresses after this course ends."	12/12/2015 3:52	187		
Student17	Student26	1	"I can tell that lots of planning and thought went into each of your application's phases. Great job on the breaking down of each of those phases into a series of steps, it made it much easier to navigate and understand your application's goals at different phases. Overall, great work!"	12/12/2015 3:59	235		
Student3	Student76	1	"[firstname], excellent detailed video. Your example of recor[lastname]g yourself being ""intervened"" was powerful and made the project seem very applicable. For some reason I couldn't find your project in Piazza's project listing. This might have been addressed in your conference paper, etc but what are your plans with this tool? Since the tutoring assessments seem somewhat basic, do you see this working better in K-12 or in any educational setting? Are there ways to import questions or do educator have to input them manually into the tool? On a side note, the clicking of your mouse in the video was painful. It overpowered your voice in which, to hear your voice, I had to turn up the volume. Then, since the volume was up, listening to CLICK to loud was distracting. Anyways, fantastic job!"	12/12/2015 7:11	2780		
Student3	Student43	1	"[firstname], creative unique idea related to Ed Tech! Your video was short-and-sweet and entertaining as you knocked drinks over. My ini[firstname]l thoughts were related to ease of use (point and click) before rea[lastname]g your paper about Oculus Rift VR. What are your plans with this product? Do you plan on capitalizing it or just serving it as a home-brew (pun intended) software product at your bar? Thorough testing with your own employees would definitely help bring it to [firstname]et. Good luck!"	12/12/2015 8:01	1159	5	
Student3	Student9	2	"[firstname], your research is original and simply makes sense. As a gamer that enjoys being challenged (I almost always play on the hardest difficulty), your pentagon model is straight forward but powerful. The key point I took away was the fact that the user MUST be challenged in order for the learning process to begin. Effective and thoughtful decision making by the player may only occur from complex in-game opportunities. Here is something to think about related to a few experiences I have had with difficult games: -Some games make me care about the development of my characters through difficulty. However, have you thought about players playing games simply for the challenge?? For example, I play some old-school games that are exceptionally hard but have relatively boring storylines. In turn, I sometimes skip to the hard parts and pass over the story altogether. My point is: By playing games in this way, I am LEARNING how to manipulate the game engine in order to succeed. I do not care about my characters, the princess, or moral reasoning - I only want to win and claim personal satisfaction for beating a hard game. -Just something to think about . . . Anyways, after watching your presentation and rea[lastname]g your paper, I was trying to find more information about your actual game design. Was there a deliverable? Your project proposal timeline indicates designs and prototypes but I couldn't find anything. If not, the research you did appears to be worth a semester's work anyways!"	12/12/2015 8:20	2029	6

Student9	Student95	1	"Nice work. Putting together an Arduino based class makes a lot of sense - developing packages of coursework for that kind of class seems really good too. Do you plan to put this into practice in your classroom? I guess I'd want to know more about how you think this compares to a lego solution. It seems like learning to solder and actually build things could be big benefits, and the price is right - what are the drawbacks? How has this solution overcome them? Can the mybot be a flexible learning platform? Awesome job. I'm sure your students will love this if you put it into action. I'd love to have taken a robotics class in school, and learning to use an Arduino is pretty amazing."	12/12/2015 12:35	511		
Student9	Student76	1	"Nice work. I design games, so I'm always interested to see game tech used for training. Why did you choose to actually move the bottles around? Do you think the verisimilitude it critical to the experience - or could the interface be simplified, but retain the visuals - to accomplish the same goal? What were your learning goals? If it's remembering the drink ingredients - maybe something simpler could be better - or does the virtual experience help build 'muscle memory' - it would really be an interesting thing to experiment with - you've built what could be an interesting platform to study that question. I suspect the muscle memory does help. It's called VRBar- so I assume you've tried this in Oculus or Cardboard - I'd imagine there the 'feel' is even more enhanced - this level of training may become a lot more prevalent if VR takes off.

Student66	Student55	1	"This looks like an outstan[lastname]g tool. I actually was not able to see your full presentation (YouTube said it had removed it :( ) but I did enjoy the demo a lot. I was trying to plan my schedule before and I actually ran into trouble because there seems to be very little rhyme or reason in what courses GT allows you to take each semester. Does your tool take this sort of thing into consideration? What if a course it suggests is not available that semester? I also thought you did a great job taking your user into account in that you made the option to limit the # of hours per week you want to spend on coursework. Given how many of us are part-time, I thought this was a very good consideration. Great work, I hope you push this to the mainstream of OMSCS!"	12/12/2015 20:50	210		
Student66	Student58	2	"Great project, I was in KBAI in the summer earlier this year and I thought it was a good idea to pick that course given how many people struggled in it. I thought the trends you pointed out definitely made sense although I agree that there may be lurking variables in the data set. For Piazza in particular, I am wondering how significant the difference is between posting stuff on Piazza versus just logging in. Could you tell in your data how many topics people had viewed and whether that produced a trend? I would love to read your article (I'm a bit of a data nut myself) so I hope I get the chance to do so. Great work!"	12/12/2015 20:54	823		
Student66	Student54	1	"Nice work, this sort of tool is super applicable going forward, particularly for MOOCs who need to compromise between thorough gra[lastname]g and scalability. I was not clear on when your program ""processes"" the files you upload. Was there a reason you waited before comparing them to the rest of the files? Is the server working on that in the background? Also, does the server spend much time processing the files? If so, you may have to worry about scalability for large classes. I thought your interface was beautifully done, very clean and easy to understand. I think you'd be able to pursue making this a widespread tool if you chose to pursue it so best of luck if you choose to do that!"	12/12/2015 21:08	393		
Student66	Student18	1	"Nice work on the project, it looked like you were very thorough in making this a step away from being released to the world (particularly all of the email confirmation content). You mentioned that the tool was open-source, is there a capability to make your own survey elements, etc.? I was not clear on that from the presentation. The other thing I was unsure of was whether the surveys could be expanded beyond one question. For scalability, I do think you need to consider this ultimately. My final question for you is whether you're planning on releasing this to the world? If so, how do you plan to differen[firstname]te this tool from other survey-taking tools? I think that differen[firstname]tion is the last element to success before you can drive it forward into a true business/service. Good work on the project, it looks sharp and definitely has poten[firstname]l."	12/12/2015 21:34	522

Student78	Student60	2	Your idea was simple and that is good. It is a project that I think is very much needed in the MOOC community. In my experience the hardest thing to do is form groups. I have been in bad groups and good groups but only by chance. The good groups only came from taking classes with people from former classes and having some knowledge of them. Great job!	12/12/2015 21:04	276	6	
Student52	Student65	2	"Wow, you and your team had a really impressive presentation and I liked how you demonstrated the use of the app as well. The explanation was clear and concise, plus it was very informative. Although an app like this does not directly impact me and my field, the presentation was enjoyable and engaging. The app appears to be very easy to use for the students and teachers. Great work on your project as it shows that you and your team put in the effort to make this a success."	12/12/2015 21:09	476

With that, the video presentation was very impressive and it shows that a great deal of effort went into the production of the iReady site and content. The iReady site is definitely a tool that I can see being used going forward by OMSCS students and hope to see it take off, all in the effort of helping fellow students prepare and discover new courses.

I would have liked to play around with it a bit, but you didn't seem to provide a password. I hope I didn't miss it. I'm sure this will be a helpful tool for the OMSCS program going forward."	12/12/2015 23:53	167		
Student58	Student55	1	You've put together a nice tool. The interface looks good and it seems to have a useful functionality.

Student58	Student93	1	"Hi Student93, I really liked the presentation. I remember rea[lastname]g your proposal earlier in the semester and being impressed by the amount of research you had done in preparation for creating this tool. I'm glad to see that it has all come together. The tool is by far the most interesting one I've seen and it's very nice to see someone exploring an area so different from the other projects. Great work."	12/13/2015 0:13	302		
Student18	Student38	2	Hi [firstname] I really loved your presentation. It was very clear and crisp. I like that a simple idea can really boost TAs productivity. You mentioned that MOSS is also being used here in gatech and I was wondering it must be a local installation instead of non-commercial internet service. How do TA�s interact with gatech local MOSS system? It must be very difficult for TAs if they have to pull all previous submissions from t-square and push to local MOSS every time.	12/13/2015 0:16	3476		
Student18	Student5	2	Congratulations iReady team! It is an excellent product and I am amazed to see how much your team could achieve in such a short time. iReady has great UI and I would love to see it become students� best guide in OMSCS program. I would also like to place my feature request. For courses� posts and reviews it would be great if we have the option to sort them on popularity.	12/13/2015 1:23	1511		
Student18	Student61	2	"Hi [lastname] I wish you have given the link to your proposal as well. This is what I understood from you presentation. There is a Flesch rea[lastname]g-ease score which basically indicates whether the material is easier to read or not. There is a formula to calculate it which outputs a number ranging between 0-100. Lower number says passage is difficult and higher number says that a passage is easier to read. And you wanted to apply this concept to programming languages. Meaning, you designed a formula which has its roots in Flesh rea[lastname]g-ease formula. And when it is given a piece of code it outputs a number similar to Flesch rea[lastname]g score. The higher the number the difficult the code is to read and understand. Now it has two great implications. First, like children books are easier to read and score high on readability index; so does the code written for new programming learners� should be easy to read and score high on Grater Index. In this way instructors will have a way to check that the code examples they are using to teach are accor[lastname]g to the audience level. Second, we can also calculate Grater Level for experienced programmers. In theory a programmer who is able to write complex code and scores low on Grater Index is more advanced than the one who scores high. [lastname], I think you have a brilliant idea and you should continue with your project. I am already feeling a research paper opportunity here."	12/13/2015 1:48	4050	7	"I wish I had added a link to my paper. I like the idea of the second use of grater level, not sure how applicable it is."
Student18	Student93	2	Hi Student93 I really enjoyed the video and you have great presentation skills. I read about your project results on your blog. Like you mentioned in your report that if the [lastname]sition of cognitive states can be predicted and notified to the individual in time it will be a breakthrough.	12/13/2015 2:56	1926		
Student55	Student18	1	"Neat area, and neat project! I�m biased - I�m par[firstname]l to any application which involves selecting emoticons. Your last slide was quite cute also. :-) For a completely different take on this area, you should see Student76�s project (if you haven�t already) which tries to assess a learner�s emotions implicitly, rather than explicitly. I thought this presentation was quite good at giving me a concrete picture of the project. Stylistically, I felt some of the slides were unnecessary. It would have been more compelling to me if the demo were done by actually clicking through the application in the role of a student and then a teacher, rather than by showing slides with screenshots. Also, some of the early slides were very similar to or the same as the narration you gave. Congratulations on finishing your project and the course! And congratulations on learning a new web framework to complete it. (I know firsthand that that's not easy... oh, how I know.) Hopefully Flask will serve you well on many future projects."	12/13/2015 5:06	295	6	
Student55	Student93	2	"AWESOME! I mean that in the literal sense - it's awe-inspiring to see what you've done as part of the course. I enjoyed the presentation so much, and I can see you invested the same hard work and determination in it as you have in every aspect of your project through the term. The only thing that I missed was a description of what you're planning to do now - I imagine you must be planning to publish your work on ASLEPT and would love to know where, what further research/papers you are planning to extend it to, and so on. I think I will probably see this go out on the blog after a while, but I'm not that patient! :-) Congratulations on such a great accomplishment - I feel fortunate to have had a front-row seat to your work."	12/13/2015 5:11	613		
Student55	Student61	1	"I found the sequencing of the presentation made it a little difficult for me to understand what your project was intended to do, at first - it made much more sense once I looked at the presentation (second part). The presentation does an excellent job of framing the problem and your goals. I would love to see more detail on the ""nuts and bolts"" of generating the badges - are you looking at the code the student has produced for different Treehouse exercises and using the metric you defined on that, or looking at code from the ""model answers"", or a little of both? This is a fascinating idea for a project. Of all the projects I've seen so far, it's near the top of my list that I would love to see continued after the term is over. I don't know whether you'll have time, but wow, if you do please keep me informed! I also think you could publish a very interesting paper just testing the effectiveness of the measure you've defined (i.e., come up with some multiple-choice test where students must tell you what they think a piece of code does, and then see whether the [lastname]-Flesch-Kinkaid score does indeed predict the number of students who get it right). I don't know whether that's something that appeals to you, but it could start a very interesting discussion in the broader research community."	12/13/2015 5:21	712	6	I have been pondering whether to pursue publication or not and this makes me learn towards it. I would hate to lose all the work I put into the project just go to waste.
Student55	Student5	2	"Ahaha! Now I understand what you meant about me appearing in this video. :-) I love it! Not only is your project a great one, but your presentation is very polished and shows me exactly what you built (and why I would want to use it!). I love the creative way you incorporated a ""scenario"" from each team member, too - it is one of the smoothest, most natural group project presentations I've seen done in a classroom setting (online or offline). Here's hoping that iReady will live on after the semester ends... I'm looking forward to using it now as I prep for CCA."	12/13/2015 5:33	391
